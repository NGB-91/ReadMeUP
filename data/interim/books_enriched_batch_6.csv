And yet for many years it was equally baffling for scientists themselves. Manjit Kumar gives a dramatic and superbly-written history of this fundamental scientific revolution, and the divisive debate at its heart.For 60 years most physicists believed that quantum theory denied the very existence of reality itself. Yet Kumar shows how the golden age of physics ignited the greatest intellectual debate of the twentieth century.Quantum sets the science in the context of the great upheavals of the modern age. In 1925 the quantum pioneers nearly all hailed from upper-middle-class academic families; most were German; and their average age was 24. But it was their irrational, romantic spirit, formed in reaction to the mechanised slaughter of the First World War that inspired their will to test science to its limits.The essential read for anyone fascinated by this complex and thrilling story and by the band of young men at its heart.",English,9781848310353,"['Science', 'Physics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Popular Science', 'Philosophy', 'Biography', 'History Of Science', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Audiobook']",[],Paperback,,360,Icon Books,April 2nd 2009,March 5th 2007,['Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction Nominee (2009)'],7799,"['3723', '2506', '1196', '272', '102']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347324955l/6448772.jpg,37,1,3.11

A little over thirty thousand acres and home to four generations, it’s kept running by Bodine Longbow with the help of a large staff, including new hire Callen Skinner. There was another member of the family once: Bodine’s aunt, Alice, who ran off before Bodine was born. She never returned, and the Longbows don’t talk about her much. The younger ones, who never met her, quietly presume she’s dead. But she isn’t. She is not far away, part of a new family, one she never chose—and her mind has been shattered…When a bartender leaves the resort late one night, and Bo and Cal discover her battered body in the snow, it’s the first sign that danger lurks in the mountains that surround them. The police suspect Cal, but Bo finds herself trusting him—and turning to him as another woman is murdered and the Longbows are stunned by Alice’s sudden reappearance. The twisted story she has to tell about the past—and the threat that follows in her wake—will test the bonds of this strong family, and thrust Bodine into a darkness she could never have imagined.",English,9781250123077,"['Romance', 'Mystery', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Fiction', 'Suspense', 'Contemporary', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Adult']","['Bodine Longbow', 'Callen Skinner', 'Alice Bodine']",Audible Audio,,18,Brilliance Audio,May 30th 2017,,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Romance (2017)'],30264,"['12243', '11164', '5220', '1170', '467']",95.0,['Montana (United States)'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492871422l/34935946.jpg,37,1,3.81

The bankruptcy of the French state and a bitter civil war within the royal family were followed by the defeat and capture of the King of France by the Black Prince at Poitiers. A peasant revolt and a violent revolution in Paris completed the tragedy. In a humiliating treaty of partition France ceded more than a third of its territory to Edward III of England. Not for sixty years would the English again come so close to total victory. France's great cities, provincial towns and rural communities resisted where its leaders failed. They withstood the sustained savagery of the soldiers and the free companies of brigands to undo most of Edward III's work in the following generation.

Suddenly, just thirty-two years old, she was a prisoner in her own body and a victim of the ignorant and cruel treatment of hospital workers who neither noticed nor cared that the ""vegetable"" they changed and fed every day was actually a bright and emotional woman. In this powerful memoir, painstakingly written with the help of poet Richard Tayson, Tavalaro details the hellish life she endured as a defenseless patient, angry and desperate to die, and the liberating actions of two therapists who took the time to realize that she was not incognitive but rather brimming with intelligence and life.At last, Tavalaro managed to break through the isolation that imprisoned her. Slowly, methodically, she regained her ability to communicate -- aided by technological and therapeutic developments -- and began to compose poems that drew on the memories of her life before her stroke.

Is it a literal week or a series of time periods? If I believe that the earth is 4.5 billion years old, am I denying the authority of Scripture? In response to the continuing controversy over the interpretation of the creation narrative in Genesis, John Lennox proposes a succinct method of reading and interpreting the first chapters of Genesis without discounting either science or Scripture. With examples from history, a brief but thorough exploration of the major interpretations, and a look into the particular significance of the creation of human beings, Lennox suggests that Christians can heed modern scientific knowledge while staying faithful to the biblical narrative. He moves beyond a simple response to the controversy, insisting that Genesis teaches us far more about the God of Jesus Christ and about God’s intention for creation than it does about the age of the earth.

148422.Jefferson,Jefferson,,Max Byrd,3.55,"As he did with Presidents Jackson and Grant in those magnificent novels, Max Byrd now reveals Thomas Jefferson as we’ve never seen before. Byrd transports us to 1784, as Jefferson, the newly appointed American ambassador to the court of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, arrives in Paris—a city adrift in intrigue, upheaval, and temptation that will challenge his principles, incite his passions, and change him forever.   Through the eyes of his impressionable young secretary, William Short, readers watch as the future president builds his dream of America with fellow patriots John Adams and Ben Franklin, while struggling between political ambition and an unexpected crisis of the heart with a woman who has the power to destroy him. Behind the face this complex Virginian shows the world, Thomas Jefferson is an enigmatic statesman who fights for individual liberty even as he keeps slaves, who champions free will even as he denies it to his daughters, and who holds men to the highest standards of honor—even as he embarks on a shadowy double life of his own.  “Max Byrd’s historical novels about the third and seventh presidents bring both men alive in ways that only a literary imagination can.”—George F. Will, The Washington Post “Jefferson has the organic intimacy of a novel that has sprung full-blown from the imagination of its creator.”—The New York Times  “Superb . . . fascinating in the psychological insight it provides to one of the greatest Americans . . . a truly memorable book.”—W. Jackson Bate, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Samuel Johnson and John Keats

By turns horrifying and erotic, Perry’s new thriller takes us on a dangerous cat-and-mouse game that pits two women against each other: a beautiful serial killer and the detective who is determined to stop her.When the cousin of Los Angeles underworld figure Hugo Poole is found shot to death in his Portland, Oregon, home, police find nothing at the scene of the crime except several long strands of blond hair hinting that a second victim may have been involved. Hotel security tapes from the victim’s last vacation reveal an out-of-focus picture of a young blond woman entering and leaving his room. Could she also be a murder victim?Portland homicide detective Catherine Hobbes is determined to solve the case and locate the missing blonde, but her feelings, and the investigation, are complicated when Hugo hires private detective Joe Pitt to perform a parallel investigation. As Joe and Catherine form an uneasy alliance, the murder count rises–and both realize that the pretty young woman in the security tapes is not a victim at all. As Catherine follows the evidence, she finds herself in a deadly contest with an unpredictable adversary capable of changing her appearance and identity at will. Catherine must use everything she knows, as a homicide detective and as a woman, to stop a murderer who kills on impulse and with ease, and who becomes more efficient and elusive with each crime.From the Hardcover edition.",English,9780345496003,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Police', 'Detective', 'Adventure']","['Catherine Hobbes', 'Joe Pitt']",Paperback,,416,Ballantine Books,May 29th 2007,2006,[],1314,"['290', '576', '363', '62', '23']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320534128l/451063.jpg,36,1,3.52

After this tour of the sidetracks along the way, the broad outlines of the true spiritual path are discussed. The approach presented is a classical Buddhist one—not in a formal sense, but in the sense of presenting the heart of the Buddhist approach to spirituality. Although the Buddhist way is not theistic, it does not contradict the theistic disciplines. Rather the differences between the ways are a matter of emphasis and method.

203795.Reclaiming_History_The_Assassination_of_John_F_Kennedy,Reclaiming History – The Assassination of John F Kennedy,,Vincent Bugliosi,4.1,"This extraordinary and historic book required twenty years to research and write. The oft-challenged findings of the Warren Commission Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone, shot and killed President John F. Kennedy are here confirmed beyond all doubt. But ""Reclaiming History"" does much more than that. In addition to providing a powerful and unprecedented narrative of events and a biography of the assassin, it confronts and destroys every one of the conspiracy theories that have grown up since the assassination, exposing their selective use of evidence, flawed logic, and outright deceptions. So thoroughly documented, so compellingly lucid in its conclusions, ""Reclaiming History"" is, in a sense, the investigation that completes the work of the Warren Commission. In it, Vincent Bugliosi, the nation's foremost prosecutor, takes on the most important murder in American history. At 1:00 p.m. on November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was pronounced dead, the victim of a sniper attack during his motorcade through Dallas. That may be the only fact generally agreed upon in the vast literature spawned by the assassination. National polls reveal that an overwhelming majority of Americans (75%) believe that there was a high-level conspiracy behind Lee Harvey Oswald. Many even believe that Oswald was entirely innocent. In this continuously absorbing, powerful, ground-breaking book, Vincent Bugliosi shows how we have come to believe such lies about an event that changed the course of history. The brilliant prosecutor of Charles Manson and the man who forged an iron-clad case of circumstantial guilt around O. J. Simpson in his best-selling ""Outrage ""Bugliosi is perhaps the only man in America capable of writing the definitive book on the Kennedy assassination. This is an achievement that has for years seemed beyond reach. No one imagined that such a book would ever be written: a single volume that once and for all resolves, beyond any reasonable doubt, every lingering question as to what happened in Dallas and who was responsible. There have been hundreds of books about the assassination, but there has never been a book that covers ""the entire case,"" including addressing each and every conspiracy theory and the facts, or alleged facts, on which they are based. In this monumental work, the author has raised scholarship on the assassination to a new and final level, one that far surpasses all other books on the subject. It adds resonance, depth, and closure to the admirable work of the Warren Commission. ""Reclaiming History"" is a narrative compendium of fact, forensic evidence, reexamination of key witnesses, and common sense. Every detail and nuance is accounted for, every conspiracy theory revealed as a fraud on the American public. Bugliosi's irresistible logic, command of the evidence, and ability to draw startling inferences shed fresh light on this American nightmare. At last it all makes sense.",English,9780393045253,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'American History', 'Politics', 'Presidents', 'Audiobook', 'Conspiracy Theories', 'American']",[],Hardcover,,1612,W.

And for the first time, Peabody is primary detective on the case, which means she has to get used to a new level of authority and responsibility. Good thing she learned the ropes from a master like Eve.But after rounding up the perps, Peabody stumbles upon a much trickier situation. Determined to start working out as hard as she grills suspects, she chooses to do it at the old, rarely-used gym at Central. After a grueling workout, she squeezes into one of the narrow shower stalls, happy to have the place to herself. Just after she shuts the water off, the gym door clatters open — and while she cringes inside the stall, trying not to make a sound, Peabody overhears two fellow officers, Garnet and Oberman, arguing. References are made to delivering product, and a house in the islands, and someone named Keener who’s supposed to look like an OD. It doesn’t take long for a naked and vulnerable Peabody to realize that both officers are crooked — guilty not just of corruption but of murder as well. Fortunately, the two clear out of the locker room without realizing there was a witness.Eve Dallas may have trained Peabody well — but this is too dangerous for one person to take on alone. Now Peabody, Eve, and her husband, Roarke, must try to get the hard evidence they need to bring the dirty cops down — knowing all the while that the two have already killed to keep their secret, and are no doubt willing to do it again.11 Audio CDs / 13 Hours 14 mins ~",English,9780399157035,"['Mystery', 'Romance', 'Crime', 'Fiction', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Futuristic', 'Suspense', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook']","['Eve Dallas', 'Roarke', 'Delia Peabody', 'Ryan Feeney', 'Don Webster', 'Charlotte Mira', 'Ian McNab', 'Commander Jack Whitney', 'Mavis Freestone', 'Louise Dimatto']",Hardcover,,375,Putnam Pub Group,February 22nd 2011,February 1st 2011,[],24905,"['14414', '7874', '2316', '227', '74']",99.0,"['New York City, New York (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440092413l/8315872._SY475_.jpg,36,1,3.13

75634.Next_Man_Up,Next Man Up: A Year Behind the Lines in Today's NFL,,John Feinstein,3.95,"In the NFL there is only one certainty: that every day, someone will have to be the Next Man Up. Football is an unrelentingly punishing sport, played and practiced at undiminished intensity, and it devours its players. Confronting injuries, trades, and the grim reality of competition, every NFL team prepares constantly for the likelihood -- the certainty -- that even franchise players can go down at any time. And someone new must be ready, trained, and primed to step in at the highest level.  Bestselling sportswriter John Feinstein persuaded one NFL team to lift the extraordinary secrecy that shrouds the sport and let him see how a team operates at the closest level. One team let him join every practice, every coaches' meeting, every players' gathering, every strategy debate. From the give-and-take of draft day, into the grinder of summer training camps, and from 100-degree practice games to the last game in frigid conditions, Feinstein reveals how a football team works -- or fails to work -- as no writer has done before. Next Man Up unveils rituals (what a coach tells a player at the moment he cuts him); rules (the inanities of league-appointed ""uniform Nazis""); conflicts (the scouts vs. the coaches, the general managers vs. the agents, the offense vs. the defense, the special teams coaches vs. everybody); money (how much a journeyman makes, and how his life differs from the multi-million-dollar-a-year star players)-every nuance of a team's life, from the owner's goals to the coach's day-to-day travails to the feeling of the sleet-soaked ball in the hands of a receiver on artificial turf.  The access John Feinstein enjoyed allows him to discuss with equal understanding the owner's management strategy, the coaches' and coordinators' plans for each new game, and how it all affects the players themselves. Anyone who loves football -- any team, in any era -- will savor the thousands of details revealed here for the first time, and the extraordinary drama that goes into following week after week, the most sensational sport in America.",English,9780316013284,"['Sports', 'Football', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Journalism']",[],Paperback,,544,Back Bay Books,October 12th 2006,2005,[],3817,"['1324', '1335', '870', '201', '87']",92.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442629985l/75634._SY475_.jpg,36,1,2.44

Ruthless? Depraved? Criminal? This is how Irene Adler, “the Woman”, has been portrayed by Dr Watson in the chronicles of Sherlock Holmes. In this case book, she will have the chance to tell her own story for the first time.  When, as an impoverished actress, her most precious possession is stolen, she vows to get it back, at any cost. And so she does, and gets away with the villain’s wallet for good measure. This is the first of her misdeeds, and it leads to a chain of others... some minor, some less so...  She teams up with some other like-minded bohemians, and together they create the Club des As, the Aces’ Club. They aren’t mere criminals but rather Equalisers! Campaigners against the Idle Rich and other parasites!  They embark upon a number of ventures: stealing a diamond from a fraudulent Countess; walking off with the Pre-Raphaelite artist Millais’ latest masterpiece from under the very nose of Sherlock Holmes...  But as well as these ambitious thefts, they put their skills to use in defending the rights of those that the forces of the Law in Victorian Britain ignore... such as the Gipsy family whose children are disappearing...  When Irene’s gay friend, Lord Clarihoe is blackmailed by an ex-lover, she hoodwinks Holmes in court, where he has been summoned as an expert on Graphology.  Sometimes, her schemes put her in danger, as when King Sigsmund of Bohemia plots to have her killed, and she has to take the unexpected action of teaming up with her nemesis Sherlock Holmes.

Italy and its wonderful flavors have always had a major influence on Jamie Oliver’s food and cooking. In Jamie’s Italy, he travels this famously gastronomic country paying homage to the classic dishes of each region and searching for new ideas to bring home. The result is a sensational collection of Italian recipes, old and new, that will ensure that Italy’s influence reaches us all. Italy has inspired Jamie Oliver throughout his career. His ambition has always been to travel across the country on a quest to capture the very essence of Italian cooking -- and to produce the best and simplest Italian cookbook for everybody anywhere to enjoy. Jamie’s Italy is the result of that journey -- and it’s a land of plenty. As well as providing more than 120 brand-new recipes for everything from risotto to roasts and spaghetti to stews, structured as traditional trattoria menus, Jamie takes you all over Italy to cook with and learn from the real masters of Italian cuisine: the locals. Far from the standard ""lemons and olives"" version of Italian cooking, Jamie’s Italy is a cookbook by the people for the people. From Sicily to Tuscany, it’s about the local fishermen, family bakers, and, of course, the ""Mamas,"" sharing their recipes and the tips that have gone into their cooking for generations.

  There were no more lions any more. There had been lions once. Sometimes in the shimmer of of the heat on the plains the motion of their running still flickered on the dry wind – tawny, great and quickly gone. Sometimes the honey-coloured moon shivered to the silence of a ghost-roar on the rising air.
Jachin-Boaz lives in a dusty town where he owns a shop that sells all kinds of maps: maps to find water, love, money, whatever the heart desires. He has a son, Boaz-Jachin, for whom he is making him a master-map that will be given to him when he is a man. This map that will contain all the secrets of the other maps combined, so that he will be able to find whatever he wishes to seek.Jachin-Boaz shows his son the map, a labor of love representing years of his life spent upon it. Rhetorically he asks, ‘What can you seek that this map will not show you how to find?’ ‘A lion?’ asks Boaz-Jachin. Disappointed, the father responds: ‘A lion. I don’t think I understand you. I don’t think you’re being serious with me. You know very well there are no lions now.’But then Jachin-Boaz leaves home, abandoning his wife and son and taking the master-map. He leaves a note which reads ‘I have gone to look for a lion.’ In the desert outside the town, there is a palace where the last king is entombed, his lion hunt carved in stone. Boaz-Jachin, who has decided to seek out his father and ask for the map, takes a bus to the palace where he makes a powerful connection with the image of the dying lion carved in stone. Through a simple act of sympathetic magic, the son loosens the spears and sets the lion’s spirit free, then begins his journey across land and sea to find his father.",English,9780671783921,"['Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Magical Realism', 'American', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Americana', 'Speculative Fiction']",[],Paperback,,192,Pocket,August 1st 1974,1973,[],424,"['136', '172', '87', '25', '4']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1240508887l/2242385.jpg,36,1,6.06

804579.Las_Grandes_Pruebas_Del_Esp_ritu,Las Grandes Pruebas Del Espíritu,,Henri Michaux,4.0,"En Occidente, Henri Michaux es sin duda quien mejor supo explorar —y pensar y reflexionar sobre— los laberintos mentales de las fantasías y del ensueño no sólo en los estados llamados normales de las personas, sino también en los estados alucinatorios provocados ya sea por los desórdenes mentales naturales, ya sea por los producidos por distintos tipos de droga. La fuerza que parece haber siempre sostenido a Henri Michaux en esas arriesgadas y graves incursiones allende la barrera de la “normalidad” es la misma que acostumbra a asistir al científico que se adentra en la investigación de lo desconocido : la incontenible curiosidad y el dominio de sí mismo con el fin de no sucumbir, de no perder pie, y poder así, desde el fondo del abismo, seguir siendo observador de la propia experiencia. Claro que semejante empresa no se consigue sin la convicción casi mística de encontrar más allá el conocimiento de algo diferente, de algo que trasciende. Estamos lejos, pues, con Michaux de la beatífica exaltación de los estados de pasiva contemplación o de paulatino e irreversible proceso de sumisión y esclavitud a los que, en la mayoría de los casos, encaminan las drogas. De hecho, Henri Michaux narra aquí esas pruebas a las que sometió su espíritu con la misma ausencia de prejuicios que cuando cuenta sus viajes por Asia y el Amazonas ( Un bárbaro en Asia , Tusquets, 1977, y Ecuador , Tusquets, 1983). Y es que viaja solo y sin guías ; cuenta únicamente con que “el ser humano es un vasto organismo en el que siempre hay una zona que vigila, que amasa, que ha aprendido, que ahora sabe, que sabe de modo diferente” .

9671564-anversa,Anversa,,"Roberto Bolaño, Angelo Morino (Translator)",3.59,"«Ho scritto questo libro per me stesso, e neppure di questo sono troppo sicuro. Per molto tempo sono state solo pagine sparse che rileggevo e forse correggevo convinto di non avere tempo. Ma tempo per cosa? Ero incapace di spiegarlo con precisione. Ho scritto questo libro per i fantasmi, che sono gli unici ad avere tempo perché sono fuori dal tempo». Anversa è il primo romanzo scritto da Bolaño («Naturalmente, non ho mai portato questo romanzo a una casa editrice») ed è anche l'ultimo pubblicato in vita. L'inizio e la fine, a distanza di vent'anni, di una storia di scrittore indipendente dalla cosiddetta letteratura ufficiale, diventato un riconosciuto innovatore, un autore di riferimento e un maestro, grazie alla chiarezza e la tristezza di un modo di scrivere il cui rischio principale è quello si usare la letteratura per cercare di ripetere un'esperienza del mondo, di fermare i vissuti propri e quindi, appunto perché irripetibili e mai del tutto decifrabili, aperti alla libertà di tutti di ammaliarsene e riviverli. E Anversa chiude, infatti, con una frase che è un impegno programmatico: «Come quei versi di Leopardi che Daniel Biga recitava su un ponte nordico per armarsi di coraggio, così sia la mia scrittura». Nello scheletro del romanzo, l'intreccio è un poliziesco: vi è un protagonista, da poco in Spagna, che lavora sulla Costa Brava, prima in un maneggio e poi in un camping dove ha luogo un delitto; e un ispettore di polizia e una ragazza con cui il poliziotto ha rapporti sessuali in cui giocano il ricatto e la perversione. Ma tutto è frantumato, ridotto in fotogrammi e visioni, incroci con altre trame e ricordi, con nuovi personaggi, su un piano visibilmente autobiografico. E tutti i temi che torneranno nei successivi romanzi di Bolaño, e soprattutto il suo maggiore, I detective selvaggi, sono presenti: l'anarchia, il girovagare per ricerche incongrue, il destino dei poeti, la tendenza figlia delle amate avanguardie e del surrealismo al bizzarro e al deforme quotidiano di corpi e situazioni.",Italian,9788838921520,"['Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Latin American', 'Literature', 'Novella', 'Novels', '21st Century', 'Spanish Literature', 'Short Stories', 'Literary Fiction']",[],Paperback,La memoria #709,131,Sellerio Editore Palermo,March 1st 2007,2002,[],2766,"['578', '940', '883', '277', '88']",87.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332008524l/9671564.jpg,36,1,

875623.Jerusalem_Delivered,Jerusalem Delivered,,"Torquato Tasso, Anthony M. Esolen (Translator & Editor)",3.87,"Arguably the greatest Italian poet after Dante, Torquato Tasso was born in Sorrento in 1544 and died in Rome in 1595, having served as the court poet in Ferrara, been confined for years in a madhouse after attacking a servant with a knife, and composed one of the great works of Renaissance literature. Unjustly neglected today, Tasso's epic poem 'Jerusalem Delivered'(first published in 1581) is set in the 11th century and tells the story of the First Crusade and the siege which gave Christian armies control over Jerusalem and the Holy Lands for a time.As in other epic poems, 'Jerusalem Delivered' deftly mixes history and myth. Tasso's heroes - Godfrey, leader of the Christian armies; Rinaldo, bravest of the Christian warriors; and Tancred, the Italian prince who falls in love with the pagan warrioress Clorinda, whom he eventually (andsimultaneously) converts and kills - must face not only the Saracens and their allies, but also a host of fearsome and manipulative devils, demons, and sorcerers. This is a sweeping and often thrilling tale of war, faith, love, and sex that easily rivals its classical predecessors. Writing at a time when Christianity was bitterly divided, Tasso was naturally concerned with the nature of leadership and loyalty, with the importance of sacrifice, with the evils of corruption, and with the existence of truth, themes that continue to resonate today. No wonder that for three centuries, 'Jerusalem Delivered' was considered the great modern epic. Indeed, Spenser borrowed scenes and episodes from this poem in writing the 'Faerie Queen', and Milton was greatly influenced by Tasso when writing his own Christian epic, 'Paradise Lost'.English-language readers who are familiar with Tasso's grand romance have until now known it only through a verse translation by English poet Edward Fairfax published in 1600. In order to fit Tasso's stanzas into the then popular Spenserian verse form, Fairfax had to alter the original poem considerably. Now, 400 years later, Anthony Esolen presents a new translation that transforms 'Jerusalem Delivered' into an English-language masterpiece. The first major verse translation into English since Fairfax's, Esolen's version is both more true to its original source and more fluid than that of hisElizabethan predecessor. Esolen has translated 'Jerusalem Delivered' with the care of poet, capturing the delight of Tasso's descriptions, the different voices of its cast of characters, the shadingsbetween glory and tragedy, and does them all in an English as powerful as Tasso's Italian. Esolen's will immediately be acclaimed as the definitive translation of this powerful work of faith and war. Like theFagles 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey', the Pinsky 'Inferno', and Seamus Heaney's imaginative new rendering of 'Beowulf', Anthony Esolen's bold, fast-moving, and faithful translation of Tasso'sCrusade-era adventure will introduce a new generation of readers to a masterpiece of world literature.",English,9780801863233,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'Fiction', 'Epic', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Epic Poetry', '16th Century']",[],Paperback,,504,Johns Hopkins University Press,July 10th 2000,1581,[],1038,"['343', '352', '241', '69', '33']",90.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388460843l/875623.jpg,36,1,12.66

For the first time, medical knowledge took on a precision that had formerly belonged only to mathematics. The body became something that could be mapped. Disease became subject to new rules of classification. And doctors begin to describe phenomena that for centuries had remained below the threshold of the visible and expressible.In The Birth of the Clinic the philosopher and intellectual historian who may be the true heir to Nietzsche charts this dramatic transformation of medical knowledge. As in his classic Madness and Civilization, Michel Foucault shows how much what we think of as pure science owes to social and cultural attitudes — in this case, to the climate of the French Revolution.

This is the remarkable true story of a man who lived alone in the woods of Maine for 27 years, making this dream a reality--not out of anger at the world, but simply because he preferred to live on his own.In 1986, a shy and intelligent twenty-year-old named Christopher Knight left his home in Massachusetts, drove to Maine, and disappeared into the forest. He would not have a conversation with another human being until nearly three decades later, when he was arrested for stealing food. Living in a tent even through brutal winters, he had survived by his wits and courage, developing ingenious ways to store edibles and water, and to avoid freezing to death. He broke into nearby cottages for food, clothing, reading material, and other provisions, taking only what he needed but terrifying a community never able to solve the mysterious burglaries. Based on extensive interviews with Knight himself, this is a vividly detailed account of his secluded life--why did he leave? what did he learn?--as well as the challenges he has faced since returning to the world. It is a gripping story of survival that asks fundamental questions about solitude, community, and what makes a good life, and a deeply moving portrait of a man who was determined to live his own way, and succeeded.",,9781101924921,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'Nature', 'True Crime', 'Survival', 'Adult', 'Adventure']",[],Audio CD,,224,Books on Tape,March 7th 2017,,[],53262,"['13811', '23335', '12864', '2407', '845']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474560136l/30687200.jpg,36,1,71.51
336060.Elements_of_Semiology,Elements of Semiology,,"Roland Barthes, Annette Lavers (Translator), Colin Smith (Translator)",3.82,"""In his Course in General Linguistics, first published in 1916, Saussure postulated the existence of a general science of signs, or Semiology, of which linguistics would form only one part. Semiology, therefore aims to take in any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public entertainment: these constitute, if not languages, at least systems of signification . . . The Elements here presented have as their sole aim the extraction from linguistics of analytical concepts which we think a priori to be sufficiently general to start semiological research on its way. In assembling them, it is not presupposed that they will remain intact during the course of research; nor that semiology will always be forced to follow the linguistic model closely. We are merely suggesting and elucidating a terminology in the hope that it may enable an initial (albeit provisional) order to be introduced into the heterogeneous mass of significant facts. In fact what we purport to do is furnish a principle of classification of the questions. These elements of semiology will therefore be grouped under four main headings borrowed from structural linguistics: I. Language and Speech; II. Signified and Signifier; III. Syntagm and System; IV.

9866998-once-future-giants,Once & Future Giants: What Ice Age Extinctions Tell Us about the Fate of Earth's Largest Animals,,Sharon Levy,4.0,"Until about 13,000 years ago, North America was home to a menagerie of massive mammals. Mammoths, camels, and lions walked the ground that has become Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles and foraged on the marsh land now buried beneath Chicago's streets. Then, just as the first humans reached the Americas, these Ice Age giants vanished forever. In Once and Future Giants, science writer Sharon Levy digs through the evidence surrounding Pleistocene large animal (""megafauna"") extinction events worldwide, showing that understanding this history--and our part in it--is crucial for protecting the elephants, polar bears, and other great creatures at risk today. These surviving relatives of the Ice Age beasts now face an intensified replay of that great die-off, as our species usurps the planet's last wild places while driving a warming trend more extreme than any in mammalian history. Inspired by a passion for the lost Pleistocene giants, some scientists advocate bringing elephants and cheetahs to the Great Plains as stand-ins for their extinct native brethren. By reintroducing big browsers and carnivores to North America, they argue, we could rescue some of the planet's most endangered animals while restoring healthy prairie ecosystems. Critics, including biologists enmeshed in the struggle to restore native species like the gray wolf and the bison, see the proposal as a dangerous distraction from more realistic and legitimate conservation efforts. Deftly navigating competing theories and emerging evidence, Once and Future Giants examines the extent of human influence on megafauna extinctions past and present, and explores innovative conservation efforts around the globe. The key to modern-day conservation, Levy suggests, may lie fossilized right under our feet.",English,9780195370126,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Nature', 'Palaeontology', 'Natural History', 'Animals', 'Biology', 'Evolution', 'Environment']",[],Hardcover,,255,"Oxford University Press, USA",March 22nd 2011,February 17th 2011,[],171,"['51', '80', '31', '7', '2']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347251266l/9866998.jpg,36,1,6.44

This Modern Library edition presents Stephen Mitchell’s acclaimed translations of Rilke, which have won praise for their re-creation of the poet’s rich formal music and depth of thought. “If Rilke had written in English,” Denis Donoghue wrote in The New York Times Book Review, “he would have written in this English.” Ahead of All Parting is an abundant selection of Rilke’s lifework. It contains representative poems from his early collections The Book of Hours and The Book of Pictures; many selections from the revolutionary New Poems, which drew inspiration from Rodin and Cezanne; the hitherto little-known “Requiem for a Friend”; and a generous selection of the late uncollected poems, which constitute some of his finest work. Included too are passages from Rilke’s influential novel, The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, and nine of his brilliant uncollected prose pieces. Finally, the book presents the poet’s two greatest masterpieces in their entirety: the Duino Elegies and The Sonnets to Orpheus. “Rilke’s voice, with its extraordinary combination of formality, power, speed and lightness, can be heard in Mr. Mitchell’s versions more clearly than in any others,” said W. S. Merwin. “His work is masterful.”",English,9780679601616,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'German Literature', 'Literature', 'Essays', 'Religion', 'Unfinished', 'Love', 'Collections']",[],Hardcover,,615,Modern Library,August 1st 1995,January 1st 1995,[],767,"['555', '154', '46', '6', '6']",98.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388464214l/49458.jpg,35,1,8.51

  Jungle Jack is the completely revised and updated authorized biography of one of our most beloved zookeepers, Jack Hanna.
 When the Columbus Zoo hired Jack Hanna as executive director in 1978, he inherited an outdated zoo where all the animals were caged and the buildings were run down. With the kind of work ethic and enthusiasm he's become known for, Hanna brought new life to the zoo, transforming it into the state-of-the-art facility it is today. It was an achievement for which he was well prepared: Hanna was only eleven years old when he got his first job with animals-cleaning cages for the family vet. As a newlywed, he and his wife, Suzi, ran a pet shop and petting zoo, and he later worked for a wildlife adventure outfit. You've probably seen Hanna as a wildlife correspondent with his animal friends on The Late Show with David Letterman, Larry King Live, Entertainment Tonight, and Hannity & Colmes.

While on a trip to Morocco, Lydia notices a small mark on her hand which begins to grow and spread in thin, tattooed lines that only she can see. Eventually, the marks reveal themselves to be a detailed map of an unknown land, and Lydia begins to understand that these marks, invisible to all but herself and a mysterious Moroccan man named Layesh, will lead her on a strange and perilous journey. The Tattooed Map is Lydia's journal of the days and weeks leading up to her disappearance. Each page contains her daily experiences--her growing shock and fear as the map unfolds itself, her deteriorating relationship with Christopher, her conversations with strangers--as well as the memorabilia she collects along the way: maps and postcards, train tickets and postage stamps, lists of books she's reading and souvenirs she's bought--all pasted in the margins of the journal.

He was the master at embracing his reckless lifestyle whenever it presented itself. Surviving on his ability to expertly hustle, fight and womanize, Jake could do it all; lived it all. Raised in a rundown city, filled with crime and drugs, he had survived the death of an abusive mother and a life with an absent father while only having his brothers to depend on. His lifestyle became fast and Jake had lived it the only way he knew how, until the day he met Delilah. Delilah St. James was the epitome of flawless. Brought up in an affluent southern household, Delilah's life had been planned from the moment she was born. She was raised to be the perfect socialite and daughter, and groomed to be the ideal wife. When a school internship moved her to Sulfur Heights for the summer, Delilah collided with the bitter reality of life outside her comfortable gated community when Jake Evans upset her perfect world. Over the next two years, Jake and Delilah became best friends, embracing a friendship neither one was prepared to have, although they soon found it to be a relationship that neither one of them were willing to sacrifice. A tragic turn of events brings Jake and Delilah together once again. Only this time, the feelings are different. Lines within their friendship are blurred.

Our choices and how we handle them shape the people we become.”In the aftermath of her 2008 presidential run, she expected to return to representing New York in the United States Senate. To her surprise, her former rival for the Democratic Party nomination, newly elected President Barack Obama, asked her to serve in his administration as Secretary of State. This memoir is the story of the four extraordinary and historic years that followed, and the hard choices that she and her colleagues confronted.Secretary Clinton and President Obama had to decide how to repair fractured alliances, wind down two wars, and address a global financial crisis. They faced a rising competitor in China, growing threats from Iran and North Korea, and revolutions across the Middle East. Along the way, they grappled with some of the toughest dilemmas of US foreign policy, especially the decision to send Americans into harm’s way, from Afghanistan to Libya to the hunt for Osama bin Laden.By the end of her tenure, Secretary Clinton had visited 112 countries, traveled nearly one million miles, and gained a truly global perspective on many of the major trends reshaping the landscape of the twenty-first century, from economic inequality to climate change to revolutions in energy, communications, and health. Drawing on conversations with numerous leaders and experts, Secretary Clinton offers her views on what it will take for the United States to compete and thrive in an interdependent world. She makes a passionate case for human rights and the full participation in society of women, youth, and LGBT people. An astute eyewitness to decades of social change, she distinguishes the trendlines from the headlines and describes the progress occurring throughout the world, day after day.Secretary Clinton’s descriptions of diplomatic conversations at the highest levels offer readers a master class in international relations, as does her analysis of how we can best use “smart power” to deliver security and prosperity in a rapidly changing world—one in which America remains the indispensable nation.",English,9781476751443,"['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Womens']",['Hillary Rodham Clinton'],Hardcover,,788,Simon Schuster,June 10th 2014,June 10th 2013,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2014)'],13069,"['3237', '4364', '3485', '1095', '888']",85.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1402198745l/17727276.jpg,35,1,1.96

It is a simple guide on how to cure laziness, set goals, improve discipline, control your habits, and end procrastinating. Procrastination is quite a menace primarily because it makes you squander time and disregard its importance. The dilemma is that procrastination is something that comes easily to many of us. And it is a problem that does interfere with our routine chores, performance, and productivity. Studies show that about 25% to 75% of college students are prone to procrastination when it comes to doing their academic work. Procrastination is a major reason why, often, PhD students fail to complete their university dissertations on time. While these statistics pertain to only academics, the truth is that procrastination does get in the way of our routine household chores, personal obligations, and even relationships. Many times, we find ourselves preferring to snuggle in bed over meeting a friend or binge-watching movies instead of doing errands. One way or another, procrastination does influence your life and that too, negatively. So how is it that you can get better control of it and learn to overcome this unhealthy habit? Well, that is the focus of this guide. This book gives you a better understanding of the problem at hand, ‘procrastination,’ and provides you with actionable and effective guidelines on how to control your bad habits, inculcate self-discipline, manage your temptations, set meaningful goals and achieve them with utmost focus and determination.Here Is A Preview Of What You Will Learn

When Millikan learns that the investigation has come to a completestandstill, he commits himself to an unorthodox decision. The only hope of stopping this killer and ending the bloodshed is to employ Roy Prescott, an expert in the narrow specialty of hunting down murderers throughmethods the police can't-and wouldn't-use. And so begins a stunning novel by Thomas Perry, ""one of the most thoroughly satisfying writers around"" (Lawrence Block), a death match fought from one end of the country to the other by two enemies who both understand that only one of them will be alive at the end.

31367.A_Place_of_Hiding,A Place of Hiding,Inspector Lynley #12,Elizabeth George (Goodreads Author),3.88,"An isolated beach on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel is the scene of the murder of Guy Brouard, one of Guernsey's wealthiest inhabitants and its main benefactor. Forced as a child to flee the Nazis in Paris, Brouard was engaged in his latest project when he died: a museum in honor of those who resisted the German occupation of the island during World War II. It is from this period of time that his murderer may well have come. But there are others on Guernsey with reason to want Guy Brouard dead: his wives, his business associates, his current mistress, the underprivileged teenagers he mentored--any of whom might have harbored a secret motive for murder. As family and friends gather for the reading of the will, Deborah and Simon St. James find that seemingly everyone on the history-haunted island has something to hide. And behind all the lies and alibis, a killer is lurking. In order to bring this person to justice, the St. James must delve into Guernsey's dark history--both past and present--and into the troubled psyche of someone who may have exacted retribution for the most unspeakable crime of all. In A Place of Hiding, bestselling novelist Elizabeth George marks new territory in the darker landscapes of human relationships. She tells a gripping, suspenseful story of betrayal and devotion, war and remembrance, love and loss...and the higher truths to which we must all ultimately answer.

360461.Nichts_als_Gespenster,Nichts als Gespenster,,Judith Hermann,3.76," Mit dem Erfolg kommen die Ansprüche. Das musste auch Judith Hermann erfahren und ließ Kritiker und Leser über vier Jahre auf ein zweites Buch warten. Aber das Warten hat sich gelohnt: Wem Sommerhaus, später gefallen hat, wird von den neuen Erzählungen dieser Meisterin der gepflegten Schwermut begeistert sein. In sieben Variationen ihres Lieblingsthemas der unglücklichen Liebe und der allgemeinen Verlorenheit im Leben schickt Judith Hermann ihre Figuren in die Welt hinaus, obwohl den meisten das Reisen so suspekt ist wie der jungen Frau aus ""Aqua Alta"": ""Zwei oder drei Tage vor dem Beginn einer Reise werde ich ängstlich, ohne Grund, alles scheint mir sinnlos, die Ferne, die Fremde, die Kontinente nicht anders als jeder Blick aus meinem Fenster, vier Wochen in einem unbekannten Land, wozu, denke ich, was soll da anders sein und was soll es mir nützen..."" Venedig, Prag und Karlsbad, die Wüste Nevadas, Island oder das Norwegen nördlich des Polarkreises -- in sämtlichen Erzählungen wird die gewohnte Umgebung hinter sich gelassen, und sei es auch nur eine Fahrt in die deutsche Provinz, wohin die Icherzählerin aus ""Ruth (Freundinnen)"" reist und sich in den Geliebten der besten Freundin verknallt. Nichts als Gespenster -- gespenstisch wirken die Hermann'schen Figuren tatsächlich oft, in ihrer Orientierungslosigkeit und Indifferenz, mit der sie durch ihr Dasein laufen. Inhaltlich und stilistisch setzt die junge Berlinerin, die Sommerhaus, später mit einem Schlag zur erfolgreichen und gefeierten Autorin machte, auf das gleiche Pferd. Warum auch nicht. Andererseits hat sie sich durchaus weiter entwickelt: Ihre Geschichten sind länger (bis zu 60 Seiten) und durch den häufigen Einsatz unterschiedlicher Zeitebenen komplexer geworden. Und selbst einzelne Momente der Seeligkeit gönnt sie ihren Figuren nun hin und wieder, wie am Ende von ""Die Liebe zu Ari Oskarsson"", der letzten der sieben durchweg gelungenen Erzählungen: ""... und wir legten die Köpfe in den Nacken und sahen das Nordlicht an, ins All geschleuderte Materie, ein Haufen heißer Elektronen, zerborstene Sterne, was weiß denn ich. ""Und bist du jetzt glücklich?"" sagte Owen atemlos, und ich sagte ""Sehr."" --Christian Stahl",German,9783100331809,"['Short Stories', 'German Literature', 'Fiction', 'Germany', 'Contemporary', 'Short Story Collection', 'Female Authors', 'Unfinished']",[],Hardcover,,317,S.

61449.Palomar,Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories,Love and Rockets,Gilbert Hernández,4.33,"For the first time ever, Fantagraphics is proud to present a single-volume collection of Gilbert Hernandez's ""Heartbreak Soup"" stories from Love & Rockets, which along with RAW magazine defined the modern literary comics movement of the post-underground generation. This massive volume collects every ""Heartbreak Soup"" story from 1993 to 2002 in one 500-page deluxe hardcover edition, presenting the epic for the first time as the single novel it was always intended to be. Palomar is the mythical Central American town where the ""Heartbreak Soup"" stories take place. The stories weave in and out of the town's entire population, crafting an intricate tapestry of Latin American experience. Hernandez's densely plotted and deeply imagined tales are often compared with magic realist authors like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende (House of the Spirits). His depictions of women and Mexican-American experience have been universally lauded as the best examples the artform has to offer. Luba, the guiding spirit of Palomar since the outset, has been hailed by The Nation, Rolling Stone, and Time magazine as one of the great characters of contemporary American fiction. Hernandez's work, in addition to the obvious magic realist comparisons, shares an affinity with other Latin American and Spanish writer/artists, like Frida Kahlo, Federico Garcia Lorca and Pablo Picasso, all of whom applied a surrealist eye to what they saw and experienced. Palomar follows the lives of its residents from Luba's arrival in the town to her exit, twenty years later. Included are such classic tales as ""Sopa de Gran Pena,"" ""Ecce Homo,"" ""An American in Palomar,"" ""Human Diastrophism,"" and ""Farewell, Mi Palomar."" Palomar presents one of the richest accomplishments in the history of the artform in its ideal format for the first time, making it a must-have for longtime Love & Rockets fans and new readers alike.",English,9781560975397,"['Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Fiction', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Comix', 'Comic Book', 'Fantasy', 'Short Stories', 'Art', 'Novels']",[],Hardcover,,512,Fantagraphics,November 17th 2003,July 2003,[],2070,"['1166', '557', '235', '79', '33']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327877860l/61449.jpg,34,1,104.00

But plenty of excitement (and shocks) are coming Jack's way once his mom loans him out to help a feisty old neighbor with a most unusual chore—typewriting obituaries filled with stories about the people who founded his Utopian town. As one obituary leads to another, Jack is launched on a strange adventure involving molten wax, Eleanor Roosevelt, twisted promises, a homemade airplane, Girl Scout cookies, a man on a trike, a dancing plague, voices from the past, Hells Angels . . . and possibly murder. Endlessly surprising, this sly, sharp-edged narrative is the author at his very best, making readers laugh out loud at the most unexpected things in a dead-funny depiction of growing up in a slightly off-kilter place where the past is present, the present is confusing, and the future is completely up in the air.  ",English,9780374379933,"['Historical Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Middle Grade', 'Humor', 'Fiction', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Historical', 'Mystery', 'Juvenile']",[],Hardcover,,341,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux (BYR)",September 13th 2011,,"['Newbery Medal (2012)', ""Scott O'Dell Award (2012)"", ""Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award Nominee for Grades 6-8 (2014)"", ""Boston Author's Club Young Reader Award Nominee (2012)""]",19033,"['4982', '6718', '5106', '1595', '632']",88.0,"['Norvelt, Pennsylvania (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1371074276l/9858488.jpg,34,1,3.81

We are not soldiers.” —MACE WINDU  Star Wars:   Episode II: Attack of the Clones  Mace Windu is a living legend: Jedi Master, senior member of the Jedi Council, skilled diplomat, devastating fighter. Some say he is the deadliest man alive. But he is a man of peace—and for the first time in a thousand years, the galaxy is at war.  Now, following the momentous events climaxing in the Battle of Geonosis, Master Mace Windu must undertake a perilous homecoming to his native world—to defuse a potentially catastrophic crisis for the Republic . . . and to confront a terrifying mystery with dire personal consequences.  The jungle planet of Haruun Kal, the homeworld Mace barely remembers, has become a battleground in the increasing hostilities between the Republic and the renegade Separatist movement. The Jedi Council has sent Depa Billaba—Mace’s former Padawan and fellow Council member—to Haruun Kal to train the local tribesmen as a guerilla resistance force, to fight against the Separatists who control the planet and its strategic star system with their droid armies. But now the Separatists have pulled back, and Depa has not returned. The only clue to her disappearance is a cryptic recording left at the scene of a brutal massacre: a recording that hints of madness and murder, and the darkness in the jungle . . . a recording in Depa’s own voice.  Mace Windu trained her. Only he can find her. Only he can learn what has changed her. Only he can stop her.  Jedi were never intended to be soldiers. But now they have no choice. Mace must journey alone into the most treacherous jungle in the galaxy—and into his own heritage. He will leave behind the Republic he serves, the civilization he believes in, everything but his passion for peace and his devotion to his former Padawan. And he will learn the terrible price that must be paid, when keepers of the peace are forced to make war. . . .Features a bonus section following the novel that includes a primer on the Star Wars expanded universe, and over half a dozen excerpts from some of the most popular Star Wars books of the last thirty years!",English,9780345455741,"['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels', 'War', 'Adventure', 'Space']",['Mace Windu'],Paperback,,419,Del Rey,April 27th 2004,2001,[],7042,"['2345', '2223', '1837', '523', '114']",91.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415588354l/320326.jpg,34,1,8.48

At eight, still too small to mount her horse unaided, she was galloping miles, alone, across Coorain, her parents' thirty thousand windswept, drought-haunted acres in the Australian outback, doing a ""man's job"" of helping herd the sheep because World War II had taken away the able-bodied men. She loved (and makes us see and feel) the vast unpeopled landscape, beautiful and hostile, whose uncertain weathers tormented the sheep ranchers with conflicting promises of riches and inescapable disaster. She adored (and makes us know) her large-visioned father and her strong, radiant mother, who had gone willingly with him into a pioneering life of loneliness and bone-breaking toil, who seemed miraculously to succeed in creating a warmly sheltering home in the harsh outback, and who, upon her husband's sudden death when Jill was ten, began to slide—bereft of the partnership of work and love that had so utterly fulfilled her—into depression and dependency.We see Jill, staggered by the loss of her father, catapulted to what seemed another planet—the suburban Sydney of the 1950s and its crowded, noisy, cliquish school life. Then the heady excitement of the University, but with it a yet more demanding course of lessons—Jill embracing new ideas, new possibilities, while at the same time trying to be mother to her mother and resenting it, escaping into drink, pulling herself back, striking a balance. We see her slowly gaining strength, coming into her own emotionally and intellectually and beginning the joyous love affair that gave wings to her newfound self.Worlds away from Coorain, in America, Jill Conway became a historian and the first woman president of Smith College. Her story of Coorain and the road from Coorain startles by its passion and evocative power, by its understanding of the ways in which a total, deep-rooted commitment to place—or to a dream—can at once liberate and imprison.

Based on extensive research in Australia and Japan, and including previously unpublished documents, Kokoda intimately relates the stories of ordinary soldiers in 'the world's worst killing field', and examines the role of commanders in sending ill-equipped, unqualified Australian troops into battles that resulted in near 100 per cent casualty rates. It was a war without mercy, fought back and forth along 90 miles (145 km) of river crossings, steep inclines and precipitous descents, with both sides wracked by hunger and disease, and terrified of falling into enemy hands. Defeat was unthinkable: the Australian soldier was fighting for his homeland against an unyielding aggressor; the Japanese ordered to fight to the death in a bid to conquer 'Greater East Asia'.

Feynman's contributions to twentieth-century physics, but few realize how engaged he was with the world around him -- how deeply and thoughtfully he considered the religious, political, and social issues of his day. Now, a wonderful book -- based on a previously unpublished, three-part public lecture he gave at the University of Washington in 1963 -- shows us this other side of Feynman, as he expounds on the inherent conflict between science and religion, people's distrust of politicians, and our universal fascination with flying saucers, faith healing, and mental telepathy. Here we see Feynman in top form: nearly bursting into a Navajo war chant, then pressing for an overhaul of the English language (if you want to know why Johnny can't read, just look at the spelling of ""friend""); and, finally, ruminating on the death of his first wife from tuberculosis.

816070.Little_Novels_of_Sicily,Little Novels of Sicily,,"Giovanni Verga, D.H. Lawrence (Translator)",3.76,"First Published in a single volume in 1883, the stories collected in Little Novels of Sicily are drawn from the Sicily of Giovanni Verga's childhood, reported at the time to be the poorest place in Europe. Verga's style is swift, sure, and implacable; he plunges into his stories almost in midbreath, and tells them with a stark economy of words. There's something dark and tightly coiled at the heart of each story, an ironic, bitter resolution that is belied by the deceptive simplicity of Verga's prose, and Verga strikes just when the reader's not expecting it. Translator D. H. Lawrence surely found echoes of his own upbringing in Verga's sketches of Sicilian life: the class struggle between property owners and tenants, the relationship between men and the land, and the unsentimental, sometimes startlingly lyric evocation of the landscape. Just as Lawrence veers between loving and despising the industrial North and its people, so too Verga shifts between affection for and ironic detachment from the superstitious, uneducated, downtrodden working poor of Sicily. If Verga reserves pity for anyone or anything, it is the children and the animals, but he doesn't spare them. In his experience, it is the innocents who suffer first and last and always.",English,9781883642549,"['Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Italian Literature', 'Fiction', 'Italy', 'Literature', '19th Century', 'Drama']",[],Paperback,,156,Steerforth,February 1st 2000,1883,[],191,"['46', '70', '62', '10', '3']",93.0,['Sicily (Italy)'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320561533l/816070.jpg,34,1,5.67

Now, in her stunning follow-up, An Altar in the World, she shares how she learned to encounter God beyond the walls of any church.  From simple practices such as walking, working, and getting lost to deep meditations on topics like prayer and pronouncing blessings, Taylor reveals concrete ways to discover the sacred in the small things we do and see. Something as ordinary as hanging clothes on a clothesline becomes an act of devotion if we pay attention to what we are doing and take time to attend to the sights, smells, and sounds around us. Making eye contact with the cashier at the grocery store becomes a moment of true human connection. Allowing yourself to get lost leads to new discoveries. Under Taylor's expert guidance, we come to question conventional distinctions between the sacred and the secular, learning that no physical act is too earthbound or too humble to become a path to the divine.

40536236-sea-people,Sea People: The Puzzle of Polynesia,,Christina Thompson (Goodreads Author),4.21,"A blend of Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel and Simon Winchester’s Pacific, a thrilling intellectual detective story that looks deep into the past to uncover who first settled the islands of the remote Pacific, where they came from, how they got there, and how we know. For more than a millennium, Polynesians have occupied the remotest islands in the Pacific Ocean, a vast triangle stretching from Hawaii to New Zealand to Easter Island. Until the arrival of European explorers they were the only people to have ever lived there. Both the most closely related and the most widely dispersed people in the world before the era of mass migration, Polynesians can trace their roots to a group of epic voyagers who ventured out into the unknown in one of the greatest adventures in human history.How did the earliest Polynesians find and colonize these far-flung islands? How did a people without writing or metal tools conquer the largest ocean in the world? This conundrum, which came to be known as the Problem of Polynesian Origins, emerged in the eighteenth century as one of the great geographical mysteries of mankind.For Christina Thompson, this mystery is personal: her Maori husband and their sons descend directly from these ancient navigators. In Sea People, Thompson explores the fascinating story of these ancestors, as well as those of the many sailors, linguists, archaeologists, folklorists, biologists, and geographers who have puzzled over this history for three hundred years. A masterful mix of history, geography, anthropology, and the science of navigation, Sea People combines the thrill of exploration with the drama of discovery in a vivid tour of one of the most captivating regions in the world.Sea People includes an 8-page photo insert, illustrations throughout, and 2 endpaper maps.",English,9780062060877,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Anthropology', 'Science', 'Travel', 'Audiobook', 'World History', 'Historical', 'Geography', 'Asia']",[],Hardcover,,384,Harper,March 12th 2019,,[],1876,"['716', '888', '234', '25', '13']",98.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1542039373l/40536236._SY475_.jpg,34,1,7.46

AdventureCats.org took off like wildfire, with attention from Wired, the Huffington Post, Outside magazine, BuzzFeed, and much more. Now, the book Adventure Cats—a collection of jaw-dropping photographs, inspiring stories of real-life cats, and all the how-to a cat owner needs—will take readers and their cats well beyond the backyard. Learn how to leash-train a cat. What to do if you encounter wildlife on the trail. Plus, winter safety tips, and how to bring a little bit of the outdoors to an indoor cat. The stories themselves are catnip for animal lovers, from Nanakuli, the one-eyed cat who hangs ten; to Georgie, a four-year-old gray tabby who lives on a sailboat; to Quandary, who not only insists on hiking with her family but also teaches them a valuable lesson: When you follow your cat’s natural tendency to wander, you experience the outdoors at a slower, richer pace. This book will delight every cat person, regardless of whether their pet is inclined to adventure.

In the ten years since, she had abandoned her youthful impetuousness and transformed herself into a housekeeper -- disguising her beauty beneath a servant's dour clothing determined to conquer the passions of the past.But Sebastian Durant, Viscount Whitfield, did recognize her as a Fairchild, one of his family's bitter enemies. When he demanded her help recovering a stolen diary, she dared not refuse him. When he proposed they masquerade as a betrothed couple, loyalty forced her to agree. And when the restraint between them shattered and pleasure became an obsession, Mary had to trust a powerful man who could send her to the gallows ... or love her through eternity. ",English,9780380790890,"['Historical Romance', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Regency', 'Historical Fiction', 'Regency Romance', 'Fiction', 'Adult', 'M F Romance', 'Georgian']",[],Paperback,,384,Avon,August 1st 1997,1997,[],1830,"['415', '604', '548', '196', '67']",86.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388452828l/490425.jpg,33,1,3.10

6573838-henri-matisse,Henri Matisse: Cut-Outs - Drawing with Scissors,,"Gilles Néret, Xavier-Gilles Neret",4.3,"A perfect facsimile of Jazz, a 20th century masterpiece This two-volume edition includes a perfect facsimile of Matisse's seminal cut-out work: Jazz. At last, readers can experience Jazz as if holding the 1947 original. The reputation of Henri Matisse (1869–1954) as the most important artist of the modern era is rivaled only by Picasso—who himself said, ""All things considered, there is only Matisse."" Towards the end of his monumental career as a painter, sculptor, and lithographer, an elderly, sickly Matisse was unable to stand and use a paintbrush. So at almost 80 years of age, he developed a new technique: he drew shapes on colored paper, cut them out and pasted them together. These gouaches decoupées (gouache cut-outs) represented a revolution in modern art, yet their simplicity was dismissed by many critics as the folly of a senile old man. Later critics realized that Matisse had found a brilliant solution to the age-old conflict between line and color—one that would profoundly influence generations of artists to come. Printed in exactly the same colors, using paper and inks similar to the 1947 edition, the facsimile volume allows readers to experience Jazz in its original, unbound form. * Printed in 18 colors on a small offset press, 4 pages at a time, to obtain the highest fidelity to the original * Printed on Old Mill in 190 g/m² from Italian paper mill Fedrigoni. This paper is of archival quality and has a felt-like softness, much like handmade paper * As with the original, this reprint is unbound and folded in signatures of 4 pages. It is protected by a French folded jacket and a hard-backed cover The second volume provides a thorough historical context to Matisse's cut-outs, tracing their genesis in his 1930 trip to Tahiti, through to his final years in Nice. Also included are other pivotal works from his later career, including his contributions to Verve magazine and his exquisite decoration of the Vence Chapel. Includes rare and historic photographs by Matisse taken in Tahiti, as well as photos of Matisse by Henri Cartier-Bresson, Brassaï, and the filmmaker Murnau. The text is supplemented by quotations from Matisse, Picasso, E.

Un segreto condiviso solo da due persone, una delle quali adesso giace cadavere a pochi metri da quella raccolta inestimabile. L'altra, costretta alla fuga, ha appena il tempo di imprimersi in testa un'informazione fondamentale, da tramandare a tutti i costi...

It is the work of the constantly amazing wrestler-writer Mick Foley, whose two volumes of autobiography, Have a Nice Day! and Foley Is Good, were each number one on the New York Times National Best-seller List.It tells the story and speaks in the voice—at once innocent and too knowing for his age—of Antietam (Andy) Brown, named for the great-great-great- grandfather who died on that Civil War battlefield. Andy at seventeen is himself the veteran of a violent boyhood, having been locked up in the Northern Virginia Juvenile Detention Center for killing a teenager who attempted to rape him.Now, after seven years, he is out, free, at a crossroads, trying to make a fresh start, to fit into the life of Conestoga High School in the small upstate New York town to which he has been brought by his father—absent from his life since he was a month old. The man is certainly charismatic. He is also crude, apparently addicted to bodybuilding, beer swilling, and (his own words for his serial womanizing) “bareback riding.” He has no visible job, no known past.Associated by the town with his father’s coarseness, hectored by the boorish football coach and the coach’s pack of steroid-pumping teens, feeling himself losing ground, Andy is stunned to discover that the most popular girl in town is attracted to him. Terri, the homecoming queen, the school beauty, every boy’s dream girl, a born-again Christian, a really nice girl. Andy can’t believe it. He is immediately head over heels in love—first love—and determined to protect Terri from everything bad on earth. Worried that his father, even he himself, might contaminate her, and determined for her sake to discover what his father is, Andy begins to delve into the locked rooms and dangerous currents of the elder Tietam Brown’s past and present. What happens is told in a novel that is appealingly direct, moving, and altogether pleasurable in its superb storytelling and celebration of the human spirit.",English,9780375415500,"['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Humor', 'Coming Of Age', 'Comedy', 'Young Adult', 'Literature', 'Horror', 'Literary Fiction', 'Drama']",[],Hardcover,,256,Knopf,July 8th 2003,January 1st 2003,[],1211,"['301', '448', '326', '111', '25']",89.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436016771l/820579._SX318_.jpg,33,1,3.13

Niemand vermoedt dat een oeroude, zeer listige vijand zijn streken nog niet heeft verleerd.Patrick Hyde en Tony Godwin, beiden door de roemruchte Sir Kenneth opgeleid, houden het Engelse Reid-concern nauwlettend in de gaten.

23926.Complete_Poems,Complete Poems (Library of Classic Poets),,Edgar Allan Poe,4.31,"Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is internationally renowned as a pioneering master of the macabre. He is regarded as one of the world's great short story writers as well as a great lyric poet, and is credited with inventing the detective story and the modern gothic horror tale. He has been an important influence on many major American and European writers including William Faulkner, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Baudelaire, H.P. Lovecraft, and William Butler Yeats, among many others.Poe's poetry, which is collected in this volume, is more personal than his prose. The themes of love, death, and despair which recur throughout reflect the anguish he suffered in his own troubled life. ""Annabel Lee"" is a haunting lament to his young wife, Virginia, who died of tuberculosis. ""The Bells"" is an eerie and melancholy meditation which recreates with brilliant musical language the hypnotic, funereal aura of ringing bells. ""The Raven"" is a comic tour de force in which the protagonist turns his strange visitor into a symbol of his own sorrow and loss.

215854.Terpsichore_in_Sneakers,Terpsichore in Sneakers: Post-Modern Dance,,Sally Banes,4.18,"Drawing on the postmodern perspective and concerns that informed her groundbreaking Terpischore in Sneakers, Sally Bane's Writing Dancing documents the background and development of avant-garde and popular dance, analyzing individual artists, performances, and entire dance movements. With a sure grasp of shifting cultural dynamics, Banes shows how postmodern dance is integrally connected to other oppositional, often marginalized strands of dance culture, and considers how certain kinds of dance move from the margins to the mainstream.Banes begins by considering the act of dance criticism itself, exploring its modes, methods, and underlying assumptions and examining the work of other critics. She traces the development of contemporary dance from the early work of such influential figures as Merce Cunningham and George Balanchine to such contemporary choreographers as Molissa Fenley, Karole Armitage, and Michael Clark. She analyzes the contributions of the Judson Dance Theatre and the Workers' Dance League, the emergence of Latin postmodern dance in New York, and the impact of black jazz in Russia. In addition, Banes explores such untraditional performance modes as breakdancing and the ""drunk dancing"" of Fred Astaire.",English,9780819561602,"['Art', 'Music']",[],Paperback,,311,Wesleyan University Press,June 1st 1987,1980,[],49,"['23', '13', '12', '1', '0']",98.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347584078l/215854.jpg,33,1,9.06

But when he opens an innocuous-looking letter addressed to him at The Source, he discovers that someone else excels at ferreting out secrets as well.Ten-year-old Charlotte Bowen has been abducted, and if Luxford does not admit publicly to having fathered her, she will die. But Charlotte's existence is Luxford's most fiercely guarded secret, and acknowledging her as his child will throw more than one life and career into chaos. Luxford knows that the story of Charlotte's paternity could make him a laughingstock and reveal to his beautiful wife and son the lie he's lived for a decade. Yet it's not only Luxford's reputation that's on the line: it's also the reputation—and career—of Charlotte Bowen's mother. For she is Undersecretary of State for the Home Office, one of the most high-profile Junior Ministers and quite possibly the next Margaret Thatcher.Knowing that her political future hangs in the balance, Eve Bowen refuses to let Luxford damage her career by printing the story or calling the police.

During the day she went through the motions at her prep school, in class, with her friends, but that's all it was. For Emma, life had stopped with Nathan's death.But tonight was different. Tonight Emma and her dog were not alone in the cemetery. There were two others there--Eric, who had just started at her school, and an ancient woman who looked as though she were made of rags. And when they saw Emma there, the old woman reached out to her with a grip as chilling as death....Emma was not quite like others teenagers. It was true that other girls had experienced grief. Other girls had also lost their fathers, or had their boyfriends die in a senseless accident. But though she hadn't known it till that night in the graveyard, unlike those other girls, she could see, touch, and speak with the dead. In fact, Emma could draw upon the essence of the dead to work magic. That was what Necromancers did.But Emma had no desire to be a Necromancer. She just wanted to help the ghosts who walked the streets of Toronto, unable to escape from the land of the living. And that was just as well, because had she chosen the path of the Necromancer, Eric would have had to kill her.Instead, Eric and his fellow Necromancer hunter Chase found themselves violating every rule they were sworn to follow, becoming part of Emma's group, helping her to stand against those who preyed upon the dead. But whether Emma and her friends could survive such a battle was anyone's guess. And whether Emma could learn to use the magic of the dead against her enemies without herself falling victim to the lure of such power remained to be seen. Eric seemed to think she could, and her living friends would never abandon her.

For millions of people, the film is that rare combination of a powerful and moving story, first-rate music, and breathtaking scenery. ""The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie"" is a tribute to this beloved movie musical and a fascinating, behind-the-scene account of the creation of a Hollywood classic.Through exclusive in-depth interviews with cast and crew, stills from the movie's most memorable scenes, snapshots from personal scrapbooks, and papers from the Fox Studios archives, Julia Hirsch re-crates the magic that is ""The Sound of Music."" Julie Andrews recounts some of her more humorous memories of the filming, from her ""first kiss"" with Christopher Plummer, when neither of them could stop laughing, to rushing up the mountain for the famous opening scene only to be continually knocked down by the downdraft from the cameraman's helicopter. The book reveals details both fans and film buffs will enjoy, such as the fact that Yul Brynner, Walter Matthau, and Sean Connery were all considered fro the role of the Captain (while teenagers Mia Farrow, Sharon Tate, and Richard Dreyfuss auditioned for juvenile roles) and that director/producer Robert Wise, already fielding calls from Fox's Dick Zanuck for being over budget, almost didn't finish the location shoot in Austria because it simply wouldn't stop raining.But most of all, Hirsch captures the extraordinary camaraderie shared by everyone involved, a group whose friendships would last a lifetime.

And Sidney Blumenthal in The Boston Globe wrote that it was ""dense with astonishing incidents.""Now Dallek has condensed his two-volume masterpiece into what is surely the finest one-volume biography of Johnson available. Based on years of research in over 450 manuscript collections and oral histories, as well as numerous personal interviews, this biography follows Johnson, the ""human dynamo,"" from the Texas hill country to the White House. We see LBJ, in the House and the Senate, whirl his way through sixteen- and eighteen-hour days, talking, urging, demanding, reaching for influence and power, in an uncommonly successful congressional career. Then, in the White House, we see Johnson as the visionary leader who worked his will on Congress like no president before or since, enacting a range of crucial legislation, from Medicare and environmental protection to the most significant advances in civil rights for black Americans ever achieved. And we see the depth of Johnson's private anguish as he became increasingly ensnared in Vietnam.In these pages Johnson emerges as a man of towering intensity and anguished insecurity, of grandiose ambition and grave self-doubt, a man who was brilliant, crude, intimidating, compassionate, overbearing, driven: ""A tornado in pants.""

7791.Dr_Seuss_Goes_to_War,Dr. Seuss Goes to War: The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel,,"Richard H. Minear, Art Spiegelman (Introduction), Dr. Seuss",4.16,"Drawing ConclusionsWell before Sam ever considered eating green eggs and ham or Horton heard a who, Dr. Seuss was drawing biting cartoons for adults that expressed his fierce opposition to anti-Semitism and fascism. An editorial cartoonist from 1941 to 1943 for PM magazine, a left-wing daily New York newspaper, Dr. Seuss launched a battle against dictatorial rule abroad and America First (an isolationist organization that argued against U.S. entry into World War II) with more than 400 cartoons urging the United States to fight against Adolf Hitler and his cohorts in fascism, Benito Mussolini, Pierre Laval, and Japan (he never depicted General Tojo Hideki, the wartime prime minister, or Togo Shigenori, the foreign minister). Dr. Seuss Goes to War, by Richard H. Minear, includes 200 of these cartoons, demonstrating the active role Dr. Seuss played in shaping and reflecting how America responded to World War II as events unfolded.As one of America's leading historians of Japan during World War II, Minear also offers insightful commentary on the historical and political significance of this immense body of work that, until now, has not been seriously considered as part of Dr. Seuss's extraordinary legacy.Born to a German-American family in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1904, Theodor Geisel began his cartooning career at Dartmouth College, where he contributed to the humor magazine. After a run-in with college authorities for bootlegging liquor, he had to use a pseudonym to get his work published, choosing his middle name, Seuss, and adding ""Dr."" several years later when he dropped out of graduate school at Oxford University in England. He had never planned on setting poison political pen to paper until he realized his deep hatred of Italian fascism. The first editorial cartoon he drew depicts the editor of the fascist paper Il Giornale d'Italia wearing a fez (part of Italy's fascist uniform) and banging away at a giant steam typewriter while a winged Mussolini holds up the free end of the banner of paper emerging from the roll. He submitted it to a friend at PM, an outspoken political magazine that was ""against people who push other people around,"" and began his two-year career with the magazine before joining the U.S. Army as a documentary filmmaker in 1943.Dr. Seuss's first caricature of Hitler appears in the May 1941 cartoon, ""The head eats, the rest gets milked,"" portraying the dictator as the proprietor of ""Consolidated World Dairy,"" merging 11 conquered nations into one cow. Hitler went on to become one of the main caricatures in Seuss's work for the next two years, depicted alone, among his generals and other Germans, and with his allies Benito Mussolini and Pierre Laval. He is also drawn alongside ""Japan,"" which Dr. Seuss portrays quite offensively, with slanted, bespectacled eyes and a sneering grin. While Dr. Seuss was outspoken against antiblack racism in the United States, he held a virulent disdain for the Japanese and rendered sinister and, at times, slanderous caricatures of their wartime actions even before the bombing of Pearl Harbor. But Dr. Seuss's aggression wasn't solely reserved for the fascists abroad. He was also loudly critical of America's initial apathy toward the war, skewering isolationists like America First advocate Charles Lindbergh, the Chicago Tribune's Colonel Robert McCormick, Eleanor Medill Patterson of the Washington Times-Herald, and Joseph Patterson of the New York Daily News, whom he considered as evil as Hitler. He encouraged Americans to buy war savings bonds and stamps and to do everything they could to ensure victory over fascism.Minear provides historical background in Dr. Seuss Goes to War that not only serves to contextualize these cartoons but also deftly explains the highly problematic anti-Japanese and anticommunist stances held by both Dr. Seuss and PM magazine, which contradicted the leftist sentiments to which they both eagerly adhered. As Minear notes, Dr. Seuss eventually softened his feelings toward communism as Russia and the United States were united on the Allied front, but his stereotypical portrayals of Japanese and Japanese-Americans grew increasingly and undeniably racist as the war raged on, reflecting the troubling public opinion of American citizens. Minear does not attempt to ignore or redeem Dr. Seuss's hypocrisy; rather, he shows how these cartoons evoke the mood and the issues of the era. After Dr. Seuss left PM magazine, he never drew another editorial cartoon, though we find in these cartoons the genesis of his later characters Yertle the dictating turtle and the Cat in the Hat, who bears a striking resemblance to Uncle Sam. Dr. Seuss Goes to War is an astonishing collection of work that many of his devoted fans have not been able to see until now. But this book is also a comprehensive, thoughtfully researched, and exciting history lesson of the Second World War, by a writer who loves Dr. Seuss as much as those who grow up with his books do.",English,9781565847040,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Art', 'Comics', 'Humor', 'Politics', 'World War II', 'War', 'Cartoon', 'Comic Strips']",[],Paperback,,272,The New Press,September 1st 2001,1999,[],1548,"['654', '567', '266', '46', '15']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385317125l/7791.jpg,32,1,13.26

But it wasn’t long before they noticed a marked difference between Jonas and his brother, Wyatt. Jonas preferred sports and trucks and many of the things little boys were “supposed” to like; but Wyatt liked princess dolls and dress-up and playing Little Mermaid. By the time the twins were toddlers, confusion over Wyatt’s insistence that he was female began to tear the family apart. In the years that followed, the Maineses came to question their long-held views on gender and identity, to accept and embrace Wyatt’s transition to Nicole, and to undergo an emotionally wrenching transformation of their own that would change all their lives forever.Becoming Nicole chronicles a journey that could have destroyed a family but instead brought it closer together. It’s the story of a mother whose instincts told her that her child needed love and acceptance, not ostracism and disapproval; of a Republican, Air Force veteran father who overcame his deepest fears to become a vocal advocate for trans rights; of a loving brother who bravely stuck up for his twin sister; and of a town forced to confront its prejudices, a school compelled to rewrite its rules, and a courageous community of transgender activists determined to make their voices heard. Ultimately, Becoming Nicole is the story of an extraordinary girl who fought for the right to be herself.Granted wide-ranging access to personal diaries, home videos, clinical journals, legal documents, medical records, and the Maineses themselves, Amy Ellis Nutt spent almost four years reporting this immersive account of an American family confronting an issue that is at the center of today’s cultural debate. Becoming Nicole will resonate with anyone who’s ever raised a child, felt at odds with society’s conventions and norms, or had to embrace life when it plays out unexpectedly.

Weaving together a vivid narrative, historical anecdotes, and economic analysis, The Rise and Fall of American Growth challenges the view that economic growth will continue unabated, and demonstrates that the life-altering scale of innovations between 1870 and 1970 cannot be repeated. Gordon contends that the nation's productivity growth will be further held back by the headwinds of rising inequality, stagnating education, an aging population, and the rising debt of college students and the federal government, and that we must find new solutions.

18269500-myst-re-marker---pasajes-en-la-obra-de-chris-marker,Mystère Marker - Pasajes en la obra de Chris Marker,,"María Luisa Ortega, Antonio Weinrichter",4.5,"Se sabe que se sabe poco de Chris Marker. La vieja leyenda que podía figurar en su tarjeta de presentación -""Escritor, fotógrafo, cineasta, viajero""- ya ha quedado anticuada. Probemos con una descripción más amplia, ésta pergeñada por Roger Tailleur al principio de la carrera del cineasta: ""Es sencillo, Chris Marker es un escritor cazador de imágenes, un viajero meditativo, un ciudadano del mundo que se expresa en francés, un humanista miembro del spca, un documentalista musical, un idealista dialéctico"". Tampoco así se da rendida cuenta de quien, varias décadas después, se destapa como videoartista y 'bricoleur' tecnológico, realizando un videoclip a los 69 años, una instalación a los 74 y un cd-rom a los 76... Marker, en efecto, había empezado a trabajar con las nuevas tecnologías y a presentar el resultado en museos y galerías. Rebasar así los límites de la institución cinematográfica en un despliegue de actividad insólito en un octogenario no ha servido para hacer más asequible su obra, dividida entre los comisarios que la programan sin conocer quizá su prolífica filmografía y los cauces cinematográficos que se limitan a proyectar obras en monocanal...A esta condición fronteriza de viajero entre soportes e instituciones y autor de un hábeas que desafía toda definición, se une la tradicional cortina de humo esparcida sobre su figura por Marker, un artista cuyo mismo nombre es un seudónimo y que tiende a reinventar su biografía como se remonta una película. Lo poco que se sabe de Marker, el hombre, se basa en rumores certificados (Print the legend!). Nació en París o en Mongolia. Quizá proviene de otro planeta. O del futuro, como alguno de sus personajes, aunque es más exacto pensar en él, como dijo alguien, como un hombre del siglo XVIII y del XXII a un mismo tiempo. Le gustan los gatos, las lechuzas y algunas causas políticas. No se deja fotografiar o manda cuando le piden la foto de su gato. Prefiere que su obra se vaya descubriendo poco a poco, a partir de un círculo selecto de iniciados que se transmiten el secreto e inagotable atractivo de obras como ""Sans Soleil"", una de las puertas privilegiadas para penetrar en un universo cinematgráfico y poscinematográfico lleno de pasajes -pasadizos interconectados, más bien- que inventó hace tiempo el hipertexto antes de que tal concepto existiera. Mister Marker sigue siendo pues, por voluntad propia, un verdadero mystère Marker. Y un referente obligado en cualquier relato que reconstruya el devenir audio-visual de la segunda mitad del siglo XX.

1105253.Pan_Africanism_or_Communism,Pan-Africanism or Communism,,George Padmore,4.21,"George Padmore's Pan-Africanism or Communism shares the distinction common to most great works of historical writing of being the creation of a participant-as-historian. For, next to the colossal figure of W.E.B. Du Bois, Padmore, the political revolutionary, holds an exalted position in the pantheon of Pan-Africanism, and in this, his chef d'oeuvre, he has presented us with a most vivid account of that movement in which he played so exemplary a role. Indeed, there was in Padmore an admirable double-faceted vis historica - the revolutionary's desire to make history and the writer's impulse to describe it and grasp its meaning.The name George Padmore is a nom de guerre that he adopted when he joined the Communist Party. His real name was Malcolm Nurse. He rose to become the foremost black figure in the Communist International - the Comintern - and he was commissioned into the Red Army as a colonel. He travelled extensively in Africa in an effort to create the nucleus of a Comintern-directed African leadership. In this book he gives a graphic exposition of the history of African, West Indian and American Negro mass movements from 1787 to 1957, and their flirtations with International Communism. He helped to shape much of the latter phases of that affair. Soviet policy finally induced Padmore's resignation from the Comintern and also from the Communist Party. As Aimé Césaire stated when he too broke with the Communists twenty-five years later: 'It's neither Marxism nor Communism I repudiate; the use certain people have made of Marxism and Communism is what I condemn. What I want is that Marxism and Communism be harnessed into the service of coloured peoples, and not coloured people into the service of Marxism and Communism. That the doctrine and the movement be tailored to fit men, not men to fit the movement. And - of course - that goes for others besides Communists.'But in severing connections with them, Padmore did not join the frenzied ranks of the professional anti-Communists in remorseful contrition and fulminations over the god that failed them. Nor did he reconcile himself to imperialism and the oppressions of African peoples. There was in him a need to intensify the struggle against imperialism as also against that Communism which has been polluted by the exigencies of Stalin's balance-of-power political struggles with the Western countries. Arthur Koestler once wrote that 'if we survey history and compare the lofty aims in the name of which revolutions were started, and the sorry end to which they came, we see again and again how a polluted civilization pollutes its own revolutionary offspring'. Such an observation would lead - as, curiously, it did not lead Koestler - to the conclusion that if indeed the 'revolutionary offspring', Communism, has been 'polluted' by the civilization against which it has revolted, the struggle against this pollution becomes at once and simultaneously the struggle against the polluted offspring as also and inevitably against the source of that pollution. Padmore drew this conclusion. For though conceived by him as a bulwark against Communism, yet 'Pan-Africanism recognizes much that is true in the Marxist interpretation of history, since it provides a rational explanation for a good deal that would otherwise be unintelligible.'– Azinna NwaforThis book recounts the great saga of the rise of black people from slavery to freedom on an intercontinental scale and brings us to the crucial crossroads - a hopeful resolution for black freedom and a partnership of races purged of terror, lynching and colour lines, etc., or a continental mass struggle conducted by Africans in Africa, a struggle that will duplicate the tragic upheavals in Asia. It is not [solely] up to black men to say how this issue will be resolved; but make no mistake: the black man will cling tenaciously to his dream of freedom!If my words carry any weight, I commend this volume for close study to the white governmental officials of the Western world, to white churchmen, Catholic and Protestant alike, and equally to the dour and brooding white rulers in the Kremlin. I would urge them to read it and get a true, human perspective of the hopes, fears, struggles and hard-bought progress of the Negro in the modern world.I, for one, salute and congratulate George Padmore for his having kept the faith and fought the good fight.– Richard Wright",en,9780385073226,"['Africa', 'History']",[],,,498,"Garden City, N.Y. : Doubleday",1971,January 1st 1971,[],19,"['9', '7', '1', '2', '0']",89.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181025906l/1105253.jpg,32,1,

New York Times
   bestselling author Julie Kagawa. Dragons walk among us in human form…but soon the secretive Talon organization will make its move to fly from the shadows and take over the world, in this fiery young adult fantasy series perfect for fans of Marie Liu, Cassandra Clare and Gena Showalter!
TALONTo take her rightful place in the Talon organization, young dragon Ember Hill must prove she can hide her true nature and blend in with humans. Her delight at the prospect of a summer of “normal” teen experiences is short-lived, however, once she discovers that she’s also expected to train for her destined career in Talon. But a chance meeting with a rogue dragon will soon challenge everything Ember has been taught. ROGUEEmber Hill left the dragon organization Talon to take her chances with rebel dragon Cobalt and his crew of rogues. But she can’t forget Garret, the soldier of the dragonslaying Order of St. George who saved her from a Talon assassin—and by doing so, signed his own death warrant.SOLDIERForced to choose between becoming an assassin for the dragon organization Talon and being hunted forever as an outcast, Ember Hill now stands with Riley and his band of rogue dragons. She’s lost contact with her twin brother, Dante, a Talon devotee, as well as Garret, the former enemy soldier who challenged her beliefs about her human side. LEGIONDragon hatchling Ember Hill was never prepared to find love at all—dragons do not suffer human emotions—let alone with a human, and a former dragonslayer at that. With ex-soldier of St. George Garret dying at her feet after sacrificing his freedom and his life to expose the deepest of betrayals, Ember knows only that nothing she was taught by dragon organization Talon is true.Titles originally published in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.",English,B079K3H84Q,[],[],Kindle Edition,,1235,Harlequin Teen,February 1st 2018,,[],42,"['24', '12', '5', '1', '0']",98.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1519621254l/38750980._SX318_.jpg,32,1,

52956654-to-wake-the-giant,To Wake the Giant: A Novel of Pearl Harbor,,Jeff Shaara,4.45,"The New York Times bestselling master of military historical fiction tells the story of Pearl Harbor as only he can in the first novel of a gripping new series set in World War II’s Pacific theater. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt watches uneasily as the world heads rapidly down a dangerous path. The Japanese have waged an aggressive campaign against China, and they now begin to expand their ambitions to other parts of Asia. As their expansion efforts grow bolder, their enemies know that Japan’s ultimate goal is total conquest over the region, especially when the Japanese align themselves with Hitler’s Germany and Mussolini’s Italy, who wage their own war of conquest across Europe. Meanwhile, the British stand nearly alone against Hitler, and there is pressure in Washington to transfer America’s powerful fleet of warships from Hawaii to the Atlantic to join the fight against German U-boats that are devastating shipping. But despite deep concerns about weakening the Pacific fleet, no one believes that the main base at Pearl Harbor is under any real threat. Told through the eyes of widely diverse characters, this story looks at all sides of the drama and puts the reader squarely in the middle. In Washington, Secretary of State Cordell Hull must balance his own concerns between President Roosevelt and the Japanese ambassador, Kichisaburo Nomura, who is little more than a puppet of his own government. In Japan, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto wins skeptical approval for his outrageous plans in the Pacific, yet he understands more than anyone that an attack on Pearl Harbor will start a war that Japan cannot win. In Hawaii, Commander Joseph Rochefort’s job as an accomplished intelligence officer is to decode radio signals and detect the location of the Japanese fleet, but when the airwaves suddenly go silent, no one has any idea why. And from a small Depression-ravaged town, nineteen-year-old Tommy Biggs sees the Navy as his chance to escape and happily accepts his assignment, every sailor’s dream: the battleship USS Arizona. With you-are-there immediacy, Shaara opens up the mysteries of just how Japan—a small, deeply militarist nation—could launch one of history’s most devastating surprise attacks. In this story of innocence, heroism, sacrifice, and unfathomable blindness, Shaara’s gift for storytelling uses these familiar wartime themes to shine a light on the personal, the painful, the tragic, and the thrilling—and on a crucial part of history we must never forget.",en,9780593129623,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'World War II', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'American History', 'Military History', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Adult Fiction']",[],Kindle Edition,,529,Ballantine Books,May 19th 2020,,[],1184,"['670', '395', '102', '12', '5']",99.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1568048033l/52956654._SX318_SY475_.jpg,32,1,17.52

Someone struck her with a car and then deliberately ran over her body before driving off, leaving nothing behind but questions. What brought Eugenie Davies to London on a rainy autumn night? Why was she carrying the name of the man who found her body? Who among the many acquaintances in her complicated and tragic life could have wanted her dead? And could her murder have some connection to a twenty-eight-year-old musical wunderkind, a virtuoso violinist who several months earlier suddenly and inexplicably lost the ability to play a single note? For Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley, whose own domestic life is about to change radically, these questions are only the first in an investigation that leads him to walk a fine line between personal loyalty and professional honor. Assigned to the case by his superior, Superintendent Malcolm Webberly, Lynley learns that Webberly's first murder investigation as a DI over twenty years ago involved Eugenie Davies and a sensational criminal trial. Yet what is truly damaging is what Webberly already knows and no doubt wants Lynley to keep concealed. Now the pressure is on Lynley to find Eugenie Davies' killer. For not only is he putting his own career into jeopardy, but he is also attempting to safeguard the careers of his longtime partners Barbara Havers and Winston Nkata. Together, they must untangle the dark secrets and darker passions of a family whose history conceals the truth behind a horrific crime.

She thought the clairvoyance that allowed her to witness crimes as they happened had been destroyed in the nightmare of her past. Then one night it returned with a vengeance, and she desperately needed to find someone to make it stop. Detective Dane Hollister of the Orlando police department had never met anyone like Marlie. He had doubts about her clairvoyance, but there was no doubt how much he desired her. Her soft, sweet scent set his blood afire, and he wanted to wrap her in his arms and chase the sadness from her eyes. To Marlie, Dane was all heat and hard muscle, and he made her body come alive as it never had before. But not even she could foresee where their passion would lead: a hungry quest for the elusive, dreamy ecstasies of love... and a dangerous journey into the twisted mind of a madman who would threaten their happiness and their lives... After the Night A poor, outcast child in Prescott, Louisiana, Faith Devlin had always adored the town's golden boy from afar. But he called her white trash that sultry Southern night when his rich, respected father disappeared, along with her pretty mom. Now Faith wanted to hate Gray Rouillard... not to feel a powerful surge of desire. But she couldn't quench her passion, any more than she could hide the truth about the past she had waited so long to unravel. Even when he raised hell, Gray Rouillard did it with style. Reckless, charming, and backed by Rouillard money, Gray controlled the town of Prescott-- and Devlin was a name he never wanted to hear again. But when he gazed at Faith Devlin, all he saw was a swirl of tangled sheets and her silken flesh beneath him. To care for her was impossible, unthinkable... because Gray Rouillard planned to use all his power to ruin her.",English,9780671027476,"['Romance', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Paranormal Romance']",[],Paperback,,688,Pocket,October 1st 1998,,[],946,"['491', '284', '144', '18', '9']",97.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348691752l/72626.jpg,31,1,7.69

13166598-trinity,Trinity: A Graphic History of the First Atomic Bomb,,Jonathan Fetter-Vorm (Goodreads Author),4.1,"Trinity, the debut graphic book by the gifted illustrator Jonathan Fetter-Vorm, depicts in vivid detail the dramatic history of the race to build and the decision to drop the first atomic bomb. This sweeping historical narrative traces the spark of invention from the laboratories of nineteenth-century Europe to the massive industrial and scientific efforts of the Manhattan Project. Along the way, Fetter-Vorm takes special care to explain the fundamental science of nuclear reactions. With the clarity and accessibility that only a graphic book can provide, Trinity transports the reader into the core of a nuclear reaction—into the splitting atoms themselves.The power of the atom was harnessed in a top-secret government compound in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where some of the greatest scientific minds in the world gathered together to work on the bomb. Fetter-Vorm showcases J. Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, and General Leslie Groves, the fathers of the atomic bomb, whose insights unleashed the most devastating explosion known to humankind. These brilliant scientists wrestled daily with both the difficulty of building an atomic weapon and the moral implications of actually succeeding.When the first bomb finally went off at a test site code-named Trinity, the world was irreversibly thrust into a new and terrifying age. With powerful renderings of the catastrophic events at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Fetter-Vorm unflinchingly chronicles the far-reaching political, environmental, and ethical effects of this new discovery. Richly illustrated and deeply researched, Trinity is a dramatic, informative, and thought-provoking book on one of the most significant and harrowing events in history.",English,9780809094684,"['Graphic Novels', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Comics', 'Science', 'War', 'Historical', 'World War II', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Physics']",[],Hardcover,,154,Hill and Wang,June 5th 2012,,[],2421,"['889', '1030', '391', '83', '28']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353461506l/13166598.jpg,31,1,16.50

When a beam of pink light begins giving a schizophrenic man named Horselover Fat (who just might also be known as Philip K.

18114068-redeployment,Redeployment,,Phil Klay (Goodreads Author),3.97,"Phil Klay's Redeployment takes readers to the frontlines of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, asking us to understand what happened there, and what happened to the soldiers who returned. Interwoven with themes of brutality and faith, guilt and fear, helplessness and survival, the characters in these stories struggle to make meaning out of chaos. In ""Redeployment"", a soldier who has had to shoot dogs because they were eating human corpses must learn what it is like to return to domestic life in suburbia, surrounded by people ""who have no idea where Fallujah is, where three members of your platoon died."" In ""After Action Report"", a Lance Corporal seeks expiation for a killing he didn't commit, in order that his best friend will be unburdened. A Morturary Affairs Marine tells about his experiences collecting remains - of U.S. and Iraqi soldiers both. A chaplain sees his understanding of Christianity, and his ability to provide solace through religion, tested by the actions of a ferocious Colonel. And in the darkly comic ""Money as a Weapons System"", a young Foreign Service Officer is given the absurd task of helping Iraqis improve their lives by teaching them to play baseball. These stories reveal the intricate combination of monotony, bureaucracy, comradeship and violence that make up a soldier's daily life at war, and the isolation, remorse, and despair that can accompany a soldier's homecoming. Redeployment is poised to become a classic in the tradition of war writing. Across nations and continents, Klay sets in devastating relief the two worlds a soldier inhabits: one of extremes and one of loss.

Is modern Buddhism relevant to the problems of daily life? Does it empower individuals to transform their lives? Or has Buddhism become too detached, so still and quiet that the Buddha has fallen asleep? Waking the Buddha tells the story of the Soka Gakkai International, the largest, most dynamic Buddhist movement in the world today—and one that is waking up and shaking up Buddhism so it can truly work in ordinary people’s lives. Drawing on his long personal experience as a Buddhist teacher, journalist, and editor, Clark Strand offers broad insight into how and why the Soka Gakkai, with its commitment to social justice and its egalitarian approach, has become a role model, not only for other schools of Buddhism, but for other religions as well. Readers will be inspired by the struggles and triumphs of the Soka Gakkai’s three founding presidents—individuals who staked their lives on the teachings of the Lotus Sutra and the extraordinary power of those teachings to help people become happy.",en,9780977924561,"['Buddhism', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality']",[],Kindle Edition,,193,Middleway Press,May 1st 2014,January 1st 2014,[],284,"['126', '82', '47', '23', '6']",90.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1399993736l/22079771.jpg,31,1,2.81

604117.C_P_Cavafy,C. P. Cavafy: Collected Poems,,"Constantinos P. Cavafy, Edmund Keeley (Translator), Philip Sherrard (Translator), George Savidis (Editor)",4.38,"C. P. Cavafy (1863-1933) lived in relative obscurity in Alexandria, and a collected edition of his poems was not published until after his death. Now, however, he is regarded as the most important figure in twentieth-century Greek poetry, and his poems are considered among the most powerful in modern European literature. Here is an extensively revised edition of the acclaimed translations of Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard, which capture Cavafy's mixture of formal and idiomatic use of language and preserve the immediacy of his frank treatment of homosexual themes, his brilliant re-creation of history, and his astute political ironies.

1145587.Volpone,Volpone,,"Ben Jonson, Robert N. Watson (Editor)",3.49,"Volphone's reverential prayer to his heaps of gold launches the sharpest, funniest play about money and morals in the 17th century - a play still wickedly relevant on the same topics four centuries later. Ben Jonson's comedy depicts selfishness thinly veiled by sanctimonious speeches, lust and possessiveness poorly disguised as love and marriage, and cynical legalism passing itself off as pure justice, alongside snobbery, class warfare and greed. The wily protagonists keep a dozen conventional plots spinning in the minds of their dupes, and when their amazing juggling act finally unravels, there are yet more twists - and an even deeper cynicisim - to the story. The play is partly a beast-fable: the wily fox, Volpone, plays dead to lure flesh-eating birds that he can then consume. But the beasts are the human race, and polite society the biggest, greediest scam of them all.This student edition contains a lengthy Introduction with background on the author, date and sources, critical interpretation and stage history.Robert N.

But what about Britain's role in the world? ""A People's History of the British Empire"" challenges the claim that the British Empire was a kinder, gentler empire and suggests that the description of 'Rogue State' is more fitting. How many people today know about Britain's deep involvement in the opium drug trade in China, or that Tony Blair's hero Gladstone devoted his maiden parliamentary speech to defending his family's slave plantation in Jamaica? John Newsinger has written a wonderful popular history of key episodes in British imperial history. He pays particular attention to the battles of the colonised to free themselves of its baleful rule, including Rebellion in Jamaica; The Irish Famine; The Opium Wars; The Great Indian Rebellion; The Conquest of Egypt; Palestine in Revolt; 'Quit India' and the struggle for Independence; Suez; Malaya; Kenya and Rhodesia; and, Britain and American Imperialism.",English,9781905192120,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'European History', 'British Literature', 'Historical', 'Race', 'War', 'India', 'Humanities']",[],Hardcover,,286,Trentham Books,May 1st 2010,September 7th 2006,[],432,"['247', '118', '42', '14', '11']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1342275214l/3004197.jpg,30,1,38.19

IT CONTAINS FREQUENT SEXUALLY EXPLICIT CONTENT BETWEEN CONSENTING ADULTS. IF A LOT OF HOT, VERY EXPLICIT SEX OFFENDS YOU, PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE THIS BOOK. This book is Eric's point of view from my first book Natasha's Awakening. Taming Eric like Natasha's Awakening can be read as stand alone novels or read both. Taming Eric does contain bonus material at the end which is not in Natasha's Awakening. These are both long books so if you're after a quick read, these books are not for you. If you don't like the male point of view that repeats the story then this book is not for you although there is so much about Eric Rothman that isn't clear in Natasha's Awakening and it gives readers a chance to learn more about this alpha male who is sensitive at heart. Description. Eric Rothman CEO of Rothman Enterprises had worked alongside his PA Natasha Barrington for almost a year maintaining a strong working relationship with her while enjoying a steady stream of beautiful model girlfriends that passed through his life. He did everything he could to avoid commitment, women were for sex and to look good on his arm but slowly he began to notice something about Natasha that drew his attention and had him wanting her with a desire that was starting to consume his mind and body. It was both surprising and enlightening when one day he realised she was interested in him too and he propositioned her. One week in a hotel for sex and nothing but sex, making it perfectly clear to her that there would be nothing beyond that week. He thought he was the victor when she agreed to his terms but was the whole thing going to backfire on him? There was something about Natasha that drew him to her. She was like no other woman he'd ever been with and for the first time in his life he was fearful of being vulnerable. He had secrets about his past that made him the way he was and his PA was threatening to destroy everything he'd fought so hard for years to protect himself from.

2936415-where-men-win-glory,Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman,,Jon Krakauer (Goodreads Author),4.05,"The bestselling author of Into the Wild, Into Thin Air, and Under the Banner of Heaven delivers a stunning, eloquent account of a remarkable young man’s haunting journey.Like the men whose epic stories Jon Krakauer has told in his previous bestsellers, Pat Tillman was an irrepressible individualist and iconoclast. In May 2002, Tillman walked away from his $3.6 million NFL contract to enlist in the United States Army. He was deeply troubled by 9/11, and he felt a strong moral obligation to join the fight against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Two years later, he died on a desolate hillside in southeastern Afghanistan.Though obvious to most of the two dozen soldiers on the scene that a ranger in Tillman’s own platoon had fired the fatal shots, the Army aggressively maneuvered to keep this information from Tillman’s wife, other family members, and the American public for five weeks following his death. During this time, President Bush repeatedly invoked Tillman’s name to promote his administration’s foreign policy. Long after Tillman’s nationally televised memorial service, the Army grudgingly notified his closest relatives that he had “probably” been killed by friendly fire while it continued to dissemble about the details of his death and who was responsible.In Where Men Win Glory, Jon Krakauer draws on Tillman’s journals and letters, interviews with his wife and friends, conversations with the soldiers who served alongside him, and extensive research on the ground in Afghanistan to render an intricate mosaic of this driven, complex, and uncommonly compelling figure as well as the definitive account of the events and actions that led to his death. Before he enlisted in the army, Tillman was familiar to sports aficionados as an undersized, overachieving Arizona Cardinals safety whose virtuosity in the defensive backfield was spellbinding. With his shoulder-length hair, outspoken views, and boundless intellectual curiosity, Tillman was considered a maverick. America was fascinated when he traded the bright lights and riches of the NFL for boot camp and a buzz cut. Sent first to Iraq—a war he would openly declare was “illegal as hell”—and eventually to Afghanistan, Tillman was driven by complicated, emotionally charged, sometimes contradictory notions of duty, honor, justice, patriotism, and masculine pride, and he was determined to serve his entire three-year commitment. But on April 22, 2004, his life would end in a barrage of bullets fired by his fellow soldiers.Krakauer chronicles Tillman’s riveting, tragic odyssey in engrossing detail highlighting his remarkable character and personality while closely examining the murky, heartbreaking circumstances of his death. Infused with the power and authenticity readers have come to expect from Krakauer’s storytelling, Where Men Win Glory exposes shattering truths about men and war.From the inside cover of ISBN 0385522266 / 9780385522267",English,9780385522267,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'History', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Politics', 'Sports', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir']",[],Hardcover,,383,Doubleday Books,September 15th 2009,September 15th 2008,[],30922,"['11016', '12551', '5598', '1251', '506']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439088374l/2936415._SY475_.jpg,30,1,3.21

Most forms of private vice and public evil are kindled and sustained by lies. Acts of adultery and other personal betrayals, financial fraud, government corruption—even murder and genocide—generally require an additional moral defect: a willingness to lie.In Lying, best-selling author and neuroscientist Sam Harris argues that we can radically simplify our lives and improve society by merely telling the truth in situations where others often lie. He focuses on ""white"" lies—those lies we tell for the purpose of sparing people discomfort—for these are the lies that most often tempt us.

6407014-stitches,Stitches,,David Small,4.04,"One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children’s illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David—a highly anxious yet supremely talented child—all too often became the unwitting object of his parents’ buried frustration and rage.Believing that they were trying to do their best, David’s parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son’s respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David’s cancer. Elizabeth, David’s mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen—with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist—will resonate as the ultimate survival statemen.",English,9780393068573,"['Graphic Novels', 'Memoir', 'Comics', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Adult', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Coming Of Age']",[],Hardcover,,329,W.

From a chance encounter in a ticket line to a beloved father's final word before dying, from a random phone call to a line in a Scripture reading, every detail of life is woven into its perfect place.

393640.Memoirs,Memoirs,,Pierre Trudeau,3.92,"Pierre Trudeau was prime minister of Canada from 1968 to 1979 and from 1980 to 1984. This is his story, told in his own words.Take a look through the book. When you do, you will find that this remarkable memoir has many qualities. It is:PERSONALAs if he were sitting across the table from you, Pierre Trudeau reminisces about his life in an informal, direct way. He starts with his memories of his family, especially his mother and father, to whom the book is dedicated. There are memorable events from childhood here, such as a visit to complain to the principal on his second day at school. Later there is a lunchroom encounter with a high school bully and then, at the age of fifteen, real tragedy.“Aroused by the ringing of the telephone, I came out of my room to go downstairs and find out what was happening. But I froze on the landing when I heard the awful words: ‘Your father is dead, Pierre.’”PHILOSOPHICALAfter an extensive education in Montreal, Boston, London, and Paris, Trudeau set off with a backpack to travel around the world. He tells how he went through one war zone after another, encountering armed bandits and being arrested in wartime Jordan as a Jewish spy. These adventures and further travels through India and war-torn China left with him a deep belief in the rights of the individual and the vital role of government in protecting these rights. He tells how his hatred of narrow nationalism reinforced his stand against requests for special treatment by successive Quebec governments.POLITICALFrom the day he decided to go to Ottawa as a Liberal MP in 1965, Trudeau was clearly on a fast track. After becoming minister of justice in 1967 and tackling very controversial law reforms, he ran for the leadership and became prime minister in 1968 – the first Canadian leader born in the twentieth century. He talks about his use of “the Liberal machine” and all the electoral fights that followed over the year, providing interesting insights into his contests with national opponents such as Robert Stanfield, David Lewis, Joe Clark (a tougher opponent than the man who deposed him), Ed Broadbent, and Brian Mulroney, about whose virtues he is eloquently silent.PERSONALITY-FILLEDAs a leader whose time in office ran from the fall of Charles de Gaulle to the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev, Pierre Trudeau was able to exert his influence to break down the Cold War mentality. He enjoyed good personal rapport with such different leaders as Chou Enlai, Jimmy Carter, Fidel Castro, Helmut Schmidt, and François Mitterand. His relations with Richard Nixon and Margaret Thatcher were less warm, and he was less impressed by Ronald Reagan’s intellect than by the wisdom of the Queen.PATRIOTICWhether they loved him or hated him, Canadians knew that in Pierre Trudeau’s time, the government stood up for Canada. He stood up to the domestic terrorism of the FLQ – and he makes no apologies here for his tough response to the October Crisis in 1970 – just as he stood up to the provincial premiers (including Réné Lévesque) who he believed were blocking the patriation of Canada’s constitution ten years later.PERTINENTThe author’s preface ends with a word to you, the reader. “Whether you were a Liberal Cabinet colleague, a Canadian voter whose support we sought, or a young Canadian whose future we tried to improve, you are a part of this book.”",English,9780771085871,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'History', 'Canada', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir']",['Pierre Trudeau'],Paperback,,400,McClelland & Stewart,February 1st 1995,January 1st 1993,[],291,"['69', '145', '63', '12', '2']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387663014l/393640.jpg,29,1,9.08

16720104-the-idolatry-of-god,The Idolatry of God,,Peter Rollins,3.95,"In contrast to the usual answers concerning the Good News of Christianity, Peter Rollins offers a radical and initially disturbing statement in his new book: you can't be satisfied; life is difficult; you don't know the secret. Peter argues that God has traditionally been thought of as a product that will make you whole, remove your suffering, and give you the answers. In contrast, Rollins outlines an understanding of faith that asks us to embrace suffering, face up to our unknowing, and fully accept the difficulties of existence. It is only as we embrace, affirm, and celebrate life in all of its highs and lows that we can find God. Not as that which will make everything better but as a loving presence that enables us to say yes in the bad times as well as the good. Rollinss radically different approach to Christianity includes living in a community that is ruled by love. Rather than maintaining that we are correct, we allow those who differ with us to judge us, and we examine ourselves through the other persons eyes. Whether listeners are devout believers or distant seekers, The Idolatry of God shows that we must lay down our certainties and honestly admit our doubts to identify with Jesus. Rollins purposely upsets fundamentalist certainty in order to open listeners up to a more loving, active manifestation of Christs love.",English,9781469277868,"['Theology', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Faith', 'Christian']",[],Audible Audio,,5,Brilliance Audio,January 1st 2013,,[],975,"['332', '362', '200', '63', '18']",92.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421364046l/16720104.jpg,29,1,
513617.Pomegranate_Soup,Pomegranate Soup,Babylon Café #1,Marsha Mehran,3.58,"Beneath the holy mountain Croagh Patrick, in damp and lovely County Mayo, sits the small, sheltered village of Ballinacroagh. To the exotic Aminpour sisters, Ireland looks like a much-needed safe haven. It has been seven years since Marjan Aminpour fled Iran with her younger sisters, Bahar and Layla, and she hopes that in Ballinacroagh, a land of “crazed sheep and dizzying roads,” they might finally find a home.From the kitchen of an old pastry shop on Main Mall, the sisters set about creating a Persian oasis. Soon sensuous wafts of cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron float through the streets–an exotic aroma that announces the opening of the Babylon Café, and a shock to a town that generally subsists on boiled cabbage and Guinness served at the local tavern. And it is an affront to the senses of Ballinacroagh’s uncrowned king, Thomas McGuire. After trying to buy the old pastry shop for years and failing, Thomas is enraged to find it occupied–and by foreigners, no less. But the mysterious, spicy fragrances work their magic on the townsfolk, and soon, business is booming. Marjan is thrilled with the demand for her red lentil soup, abgusht stew, and rosewater baklava–and with the transformation in her sisters. Young Layla finds first love, and even tense, haunted Bahar seems to be less nervous. And in the stand-up-comedian-turned-priest Father Fergal Mahoney, the gentle, lonely widow Estelle Delmonico, and the headstrong hairdresser Fiona Athey, the sisters find a merry band of supporters against the close-minded opposition of less welcoming villagers stuck in their ways. But the idyll is soon broken when the past rushes back to threaten the Amnipours once more, and the lives they left behind in revolution-era Iran bleed into the present. Infused with the textures and scents, trials and triumph,s of two distinct cultures, Pomegranate Soup is an infectious novel of magical realism. This richly detailed story, highlighted with delicious recipes, is a delectable journey into the heart of Persian cooking and Irish living.",English,9780812972481,"['Fiction', 'Food', 'Ireland', 'Iran', 'Magical Realism', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Book Club', 'Cooking', 'Foodie']",[],Paperback,,256,Random House Trade Paperbacks,September 12th 2006,January 1st 2005,[],4665,"['780', '1753', '1620', '420', '92']",89.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320552680l/513617.jpg,29,1,3.07

114073.King_The_Complete_Edition,"King, The Complete Edition: A Comics Biography of Martin Luther King, Jr.",King #1-3,"Ho Che Anderson, Gary Groth (Editor), Stanley Crouch (Introduction)",3.59,"This groundbreaking body of comics journalism collects for first time Anderson's entire biography of the renowned civil rights leader Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Over a decade in the making, the saga has been praised for its vivid recreation of one of the most tumultuous periods in U.S. history and for its accuracy in depicting the personal and public lives of King, from his birth to his assassination. King probes the life story of one of America's greatest public figures with an unflinchingly critical eye, casting King as an ambitious, dichotomous figure deserving of his place in history but not above moral sacrifice to get there. Anderson's expressionistic visual style is wrought with dramatic energy; panels evoke a painterly attention to detail but juxtapose with one another in such a way as to propel King's story with cinematic momentum. Anderson's successful use of the graphic novel to tell a major work of nonfiction has drawn favorable comparisons to Art Spiegelman's Maus: A Survivor's Tale, Joe Sacco's Palestine, and Osamu Tezuka's Adolph.Ho Che Anderson's biography traces King's life from his childhood in Atlanta and his education at Booker T. Washington High School, Morehouse College, and the Crozer Theological Seminary and his centrality to the civil rights movement: his first public involvement in civil rights when, in 1955, as President of the Montgomery Improvement Association, he organized the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott; his founding of the Southern Christian leadership Conference in 1957; his help in organizing the 1966 March on Washington and his ""I Have a Dream"" speech there; his Nobel price in 1964; his voter-registration campaign that ended in the Selma-to-Montgomery Freedom March; and the tragic moment on April 4, 1968 when he was shot dead on the balcony of the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee. King not only recreates the major events in King's public life, but chronicles the daily, rough-and-tumble, behind-the-scenes political maneuverings and strategic compromises that were required to mobilize millions of people toward a common goal. His internal debates with Ralph Abernathy and Jesse Jackson and his hardball negotiations with John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson are dramatized. Anderson's achievement is not merely a political biography filled with names and dates, but a fully rounded portrait of fallible human engaged in a superhuman effort his fears, his doubts, his relationship with his wife Coretta King, and his children are compassionately and truthfully rendered.Anderson's visual approach includes the use of photographs, realistic portraiture, and expressionistic imagery alternating between stark black and white chiaroscuro and painterly full color. The dialogue is unflinchingly naturalistic and accurately reflects the moral urgency and labyrinthine political and practical complexities that King was navigating, from his deeply felt, personal commitment to a public cause to the wider political eruptions the country was experiencing. This is a respectful, unsparing, truthful biography of a man and his times that captures the moral and political gravitas of the cause as well as its human dimension. A major work of comics, depicting a major work of history.",English,9781560976226,"['Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'History', 'African American', 'American', 'Spirituality', 'Art', 'Graphic Novels Comics']",['Martin Luther King'],Paperback,,228,Fantagraphics,February 17th 2005,April 1st 2002,[],161,"['30', '63', '45', '18', '5']",86.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1458878891l/114073._SY475_.jpg,29,1,13.69

Yes, that seemed normal enough---but what was this talk about ""death trauma""?Thus was Thomas Blaine introduced to the year 2110, where science had discovered the technique of transferring a man's consciousness from one body to another.

But that was only a small part of it.

18490595-zibaldone,Zibaldone,,"Giacomo Leopardi, Michael Caesar (Editor), Franco D'Intino (Editor)",4.43,"A groundbreaking translation of the epic work of one of the great minds of the nineteenth century. (Jonathan Galassi's translation of Leopardi's Canti was published by FSG in 2010.)Giacomo Leopardi was the greatest Italian poet of the nineteenth century and was recognized by readers from Nietzsche to Beckett as one of the towering literary figures in Italian history. To many, he is the finest Italian poet.He was a prodigious scholar of classical literature and philosophy, and a voracious reader in numerous ancient and modern languages. For most of his writing career, he kept an immense notebook, known as the Zibaldone, or ""hodge-podge,"" as Harold Bloom has called it, in which Leopardi put down his original, wide-ranging, radically modern responses to his reading. His comments about religion, philosophy, language, history, anthropology, astronomy, literature, poetry, and love are unprecedented in their brilliance and suggestiveness, and the Zibaldone, which was only published at the turn of the twentieth century, has been recognized as one of the foundational books of modern culture. Its 4,500-plus pages have never been fully translated into English until now, when a team under the auspices of Michael Caesar and Franco D'Intino of the Leopardi Centre in Birmingham, England, have spent years producing a lively, accurate version. This essential book will change our understanding of nineteenth-century culture.

Delany,4.31,"Born in New York City's black ghetto Harlem at the start of World War II, Samuel R. Delany married white poet Marilyn Hacker right out of high school. The interracial couple moved into the city's new bohemian quarter, the Lower East Side, in summer 1961. Through the decade's opening years, new art, new sexual practices, new music, and new political awareness burgeoned among the crowded streets and cheap railroad apartments. Beautifully, vividly, insightfully, Delany calls up this era of exploration and adventure as he details his development as a black gay writer in an open marriage, with tertiary walk-ons by Bob Dylan, Stokely Carmichael, W. H. Auden, and James Baldwin, and a panoply of brilliantly drawn secondary characters.Winner of the 1989 Hugo Award for Non-fictionSamuel R.

That’s where Hudson “Taco” Vines’s head is at when he meets Koren, a woman who looks a little too much like his ex for comfort. But he can’t deny their attraction, and the more he gets to know her, the more Taco realizes how different Koren is from his ex, in all the best ways. It’s not long before he’s feeling things for her that he’s never felt for anyone, ever. After the drama of his last relationship, maybe this is his reward…a supportive, comfortable life with a woman he’s coming to love.Koren Garner is no fan of drama, and it certainly seems Taco and his friends have all seen more than their share. So you’d think meeting him for the second time at the scene of her own car accident would be enough to warn her away. But Koren can’t resist the sexy firefighter. A little drama might be worth the risk…even when an unknown threat starts targeting Taco’s friends. Someone’s setting fires, and the danger’s escalating with each blaze. Koren and Taco can only pray the culprit is caught before their relationship—and their lives—go up in smoke. ** Shelter for Koren is the 14th book in the Badge of Honor: Texas Heroes Series.

If you have a controversial option, keep it to yourself. Tomi Lahren could not disagree more. It’s a trick. The same people whining about tone will call you names and applaud those who threaten you. We don’t need safe spaces, and you shouldn’t be patient and wait out the bullying. In Never Play Dead, Lahren encourages all Americans, especially women, to find their voice and speak out. She skewers the hypocrisy of the self-esteem movement that has made people afraid to stand up for themselves. Wherever Lahren goes, the # 1 question she gets isn’t about politics. It’s about her confidence in herself, her beliefs and who she is. Never Play Dead not only answers this question but helps you learn how to stand your ground, discover how resilient you are and find your fearless side. In this book, she offers the antidote to all that: worry less about who might offend, and focus on who you might inspire. In the long-run, you will never regret being forceful when the truth is on your side.Lahren worked her way out of South Dakota to television fame in LA, surviving social isolation, a truly terrible boyfriend, awful workplaces, and getting fired in front of a million haters. Along the way, she was tempted to keep quiet, but she never did. Now she calls out the comment trolls, the political correctness police, the terminally jealous, and the ever-escalation victim culture that tells you all your failures are because of the system (and therefore there’s nothing you can do about it). Whether you’ve been told you’re not good enough by parents, lovers, frenemies, bad bosses, or social media, it’s time to take Lahren’s advice and fight back. It’s better to lose friends and followers than to lose yourself. The truth is, you may find more people who agree with you than you think. It’s time to shed your fear.

The HomeGround magazine anthology includes material inspired by all periods of Kate Bush's musical progression. It is a book about the reaction to her work and how her unique music has touched the lives of so many people.This is a unique book, a labour of love for hundreds of music fans who have contributed to HomeGround over its thirty-year existence. The book includes an enormous amount of information about Kate Bush, as well as memories and accounts of music fandom (such as conventions, meetings, hikes, stage door encounters and video parties). It features poetry, stories, letters, reviews, interviews, memoirs, cartoons, drawings, paintings and photographs.This is the second book of a two volume set. The second book covers Kate Bush's career from 'The Red Shoes' album to '50 Words For Snow' album (from the early 1990s to the present day).The first issue of HomeGround appeared in 1982, four years after Kate Bush's dramatic debut with 'Wuthering Heights'. Starting with an ancient manual typewriter, and a pot of genuine paste, the editors mounted articles on recycled backing sheets and added hand-drawn artwork to fill the gaps. The first issue was photocopied, the pages hand-stapled together and twenty-five copies were given away to fans they knew. Only later did they discover the magic of word processing, and desktop publishing.From those beginnings HomeGround became a cornerstone of the 'Kate-speaking world', the editors going on to organise four official fan events at which Kate Bush and members of her family and band appeared, arrange at Bush's request a team of fans to be extras in two of her videos and organise informal fan gatherings at Glastonbury and Top Withens, the storm-blown ruin on Haworth Moor. Years before the internet, HomeGround became a place where fans could discuss Bush's music, and a place where they could publish creative writing and artwork that music inspired.Fully illustrated.

109656.The_New_Fowler_s_Modern_English_Usage,The New Fowler's Modern English Usage,,"Henry Watson Fowler, Robert W. Burchfield (Editor)",4.22,"First published in 1926, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage is one of the most celebrated reference books of the twentieth century. Commonly known as ""Fowler,"" after its inimitable author, H.W. Fowler, it has sold more than a million copies and maintained a devoted following over seven decades, in large part because of its charming blend of information and good humor, delivered in the voice of a genial if somewhat idiosyncratic schoolmaster. ""Reading Fowler,"" William F. Buckley once noted, ""provides instruction and knowledge and direction, but the whole of it is a sensual delight."" And Jessica Mitford wrote that Fowler's style ""has afforded me endless amusement and instruction through my very long life."" The first place to turn for sensible advice on the thorny issues of grammar, meaning, and pronunciation, ""Fowler"" is one of those rare reference books that can also be read simply for pleasure. Now this classic is available in a new edition--the first major revision since Fowler's original. Rewritten, updated, and expanded to take into account the vast linguistic changes of the past three-quarters of a century, here are thousands of alphabetically arranged entries, offering advice and background information on all aspects of the English language, from grammar to spelling to literary style. This masterful revision has been carried out by Robert Burchfield, hailed by The Chicago Tribune as ""the greatest living lexicographer."" In his hands, the MEU has retained its beloved traits--accessibility, authority, and (not least) personality--while acquiring new ones, most notably, up-to-the-minute currency. As in ""Fowler,"" the new edition is a cornucopia of information on such troublesome areas as the plural form of foreign words (adagio, curriculum, memorandum, virus); related or like-sounding words (affect/effect, continual/continuous); rarely encountered literary terms (alcaics, alexandrine, arsis); and unusual inflected forms (for instance, taxi, taxis, taxiing). But there are also many innovations. Burchfield, who spent decades working on the Oxford English Dictionary, has introduced the OED's historical approach to the MEU, providing fascinating details on how and when new usages entered the language. In addition, he has combed novels, newspapers, and magazines to replenish the book's many illustrative sentences with new examples from the 1980s and 1990s, taken from such sources as The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books, and from such writers as Saul Bellow, John Updike, Kingsley and Martin Amis, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively. The new MEU also covers much more of the English-speaking world than did ""Fowler""--including not only the United Kingdom and the United States, but also Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and elsewhere--and pronunciation is now given in the International Phonetic Alphabet, with an easy-to-consult guide given across each double-page spread.  For seventy years, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage has supplied readers with information, guidance, and amusement. This major revision provides an MEU for the next century: a completely up-to-date work based on the immense databases of the Oxford English Dictionary, providing the same insightful, authoritative, and lively coverage that has long made ""Fowler"" a synonym for correct English.",English,9780198691266,"['Reference', 'Writing', 'Language', 'Nonfiction', 'Dictionaries', 'Linguistics', 'Classics', 'School', 'Business', 'Humor']",[],Hardcover,,896,"Oxford University Press, USA",December 19th 1996,1926,[],1021,"['498', '310', '173', '22', '18']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387706121l/109656.jpg,28,1,0.84

4645750-horse-soldiers,Horse Soldiers: The Extraordinary Story of a Band of US Soldiers Who Rode to Victory in Afghanistan,,Doug Stanton,4.13,"The inspiration for the major motion picture 12 Strong from Jerry Bruckheimer, starring Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon.From the New York Times bestselling author of In Harm’s Way comes a true-life story of American soldiers overcoming great odds to achieve a stunning military victory.Horse Soldiers is the dramatic account of a small band of Special Forces soldiers who secretly entered Afghanistan following 9/11 and rode to war on horses against the Taliban. Outnumbered forty to one, they pursued the enemy army across the mountainous Afghanistan terrain and, after a series of intense battles, captured the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, which was strategically essential to defeat their opponent throughout the country.The bone-weary American soldiers were welcomed as liberators as they rode into the city, and the streets thronged with Afghans overjoyed that the Taliban regime had been overthrown.Then the action took a wholly unexpected turn. During a surrender of six hundred Taliban troops, the Horse Soldiers were ambushed by the would-be POWs. Dangerously overpowered, they fought for their lives in the city’s immense fortress, Qala-i-Janghi, or the House of War. At risk were the military gains of the entire campaign: if the soldiers perished or were captured, the entire effort to outmaneuver the Taliban was likely doomed.Deeply researched and beautifully written, Stanton’s account of the Americans’ quest to liberate an oppressed people touches the mythic. The soldiers on horses combined ancient strategies of cavalry warfare with twenty-first-century aerial bombardment technology to perform a seemingly impossible feat. Moreover, their careful effort to win the hearts of local townspeople proved a valuable lesson for America’s ongoing efforts in Afghanistan.",English,9781416580515,"['Military Fiction', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Biography', 'Military History', 'Audiobook', 'Horses', 'Historical', 'Media Tie In']","['General Doustoum', 'Mike Spann', 'Mitch Nelson', 'Mark Mitchell', 'Cal Spencer', 'Sam Diller', 'Atta Mohammed Noor', 'Lt.

6452798-command-and-control,"Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety",,Eric Schlosser,4.26,"A myth-shattering exposé of America’s nuclear weaponsFamed investigative journalist Eric Schlosser digs deep to uncover secrets about the management of America’s nuclear arsenal. A groundbreaking account of accidents, near misses, extraordinary heroism, and technological breakthroughs, Command and Control explores the dilemma that has existed since the dawn of the nuclear age: How do you deploy weapons of mass destruction without being destroyed by them? That question has never been resolved—and Schlosser reveals how the combination of human fallibility and technological complexity still poses a grave risk to mankind. While the harms of global warming increasingly dominate the news, the equally dangerous yet more immediate threat of nuclear weapons has been largely forgotten.Written with the vibrancy of a first-rate thriller, Command and Control interweaves the minute-by-minute story of an accident at a nuclear missile silo in rural Arkansas with a historical narrative that spans more than fifty years. It depicts the urgent effort by American scientists, policy makers, and military officers to ensure that nuclear weapons can’t be stolen, sabotaged, used without permission, or detonated inadvertently. Schlosser also looks at the Cold War from a new perspective, offering history from the ground up, telling the stories of bomber pilots, missile commanders, maintenance crews, and other ordinary servicemen who risked their lives to avert a nuclear holocaust. At the heart of the book lies the struggle, amid the rolling hills and small farms of Damascus, Arkansas, to prevent the explosion of a ballistic missile carrying the most powerful nuclear warhead ever built by the United States.Drawing on recently declassified documents and interviews with people who designed and routinely handled nuclear weapons, Command and Control takes readers into a terrifying but fascinating world that, until now, has been largely hidden from view. Through the details of a single accident, Schlosser illustrates how an unlikely event can become unavoidable, how small risks can have terrible consequences, and how the most brilliant minds in the nation can only provide us with an illusion of control. Audacious, gripping, and unforgettable, Command and Control is a tour de force of investigative journalism, an eye-opening look at the dangers of America’s nuclear age.",English,9781594202278,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Science', 'Military Fiction', 'War', 'American History', 'Technology', 'Military History', 'Audiobook']",[],Hardcover,,656,Penguin Books,September 17th 2013,October 1st 2009,"['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for History (2014)', 'California Book Award for Nonfiction (Gold) (2013)', 'Lionel Gelber Prize Nominee (2014)', 'Duke of Westminster Medal for Military Literature Nominee (2014)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2014)']",10245,"['4661', '4024', '1240', '225', '95']",97.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366560404l/6452798.jpg,28,1,6.91

Mann,3.59,"The Day of the Locust meets The Devil in the White City and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil in this juicy, untold Hollywood story: an addictive true tale of ambition, scandal, intrigue, murder, and the creation of the modern film industryBy 1920, the movies had suddenly become America’s new favorite pastime, and one of the nation’s largest industries. Never before had a medium possessed such power to influence. Yet Hollywood’s glittering ascendency was threatened by a string of headline-grabbing tragedies—including the murder of William Desmond Taylor, the popular president of the Motion Picture Directors Association, a legendary crime that has remained unsolved until now.In a fiendishly involving narrative, bestselling Hollywood chronicler William J. Mann draws on a rich host of sources, including recently released FBI files, to unpack the story of the enigmatic Taylor and the diverse cast that surrounded him—including three beautiful, ambitious actresses; a grasping stage mother; a devoted valet; and a gang of two-bit thugs, any of whom might have fired the fatal bullet. And overseeing this entire landscape of intrigue was Adolph Zukor, the brilliant and ruthless founder of Paramount, locked in a struggle for control of the industry and desperate to conceal the truth about the crime. Along the way, Mann brings to life Los Angeles in the Roaring Twenties: a sparkling yet schizophrenic town filled with party girls, drug dealers, religious zealots, newly-minted legends and starlets already past their prime—a dangerous place where the powerful could still run afoul of the desperate.A true story recreated with the suspense of a novel, Tinseltown is the work of a storyteller at the peak of his powers—and the solution to a crime that has stumped detectives and historians for nearly a century.",English,9780062242167,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'History', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Film', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Adult']",[],Hardcover,,463,Harper,October 14th 2014,January 1st 2014,['Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime (2015)'],3995,"['664', '1545', '1336', '372', '78']",89.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407108939l/20663064.jpg,28,1,5.92

441495.Peter_Pan,Peter Pan: or The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up: A Fantasy in Five Acts,,"J.M. Barrie, Trevor Nunn",4.01,"This is the beloved story of Peter, Wendy, Michael, John, Capt. Hook, Smee, the lost boys, pirates and the indians, and, of course, Tinker Bell, in their adventures in Never Land. However, for the first time, the play is here restored to Barrie's original intentions. In the words of John Caird: ""A brief explanation of some of the decisions we took in revising the text may be useful to anyone considering their own production of this version We were fascinated to discover that there was no one single document called PETER PAN. What we found was a tantalizing number of different versions, all of them containing some very agreeable surprises We have made some significant alterations, the greatest of which is the introduction of a new character, the Storyteller, who is in fact the author himself. To a reader of the play, one of its most enjoyable ingredients is Barrie's unmistakable authorial tone. He tells the story of Peter Pan partly through dialogue and partly by means of his inimitable stage directions. In a whimsical, ambiguous and ironical manner he speaks here as clearly to adults as he does to children. Moreover, many of the play's complicated conceits are only comprehensible if Barrie's commentary can be heard in parallel with the voices of the characters. This device also allows us to prepare our audience with some essential background history of the Darling family in a brief prologue, and to extend the narrative at the end of the play to include Barrie's heartbreaking and heartwarming conclusion to Peter and Wendy's story.""",English,9780822213451,"['Plays', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Theatre', 'Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Read For School', 'Drama', 'Literature', 'Adventure']",[],Paperback,,125,Dramatists Play Service,December 1st 1993,December 27th 1904,[],369,"['137', '127', '82', '17', '6']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1255718800l/441495.jpg,28,1,7.66

257506.The_Western_Lands,The Western Lands,The Red Night Trilogy #3,William S. Burroughs,4.07,"The Western Lands is the eagerly awaited new novel by the most visionary American novelist of the twentieth century–a haunting Book of the Dead for the nuclear age.Every new work from the pen of William S. Burroughs is an important literary event. This is especially so in the case of The Western Lands. For in this novel, Burroughs completes a trilogy that began with Cities of the Red Night and The Place of Dead Roads, with a profound, revealing, and often astounding meditation on the themes of mortality, loneliness, nuclear peril–and the inextinguishable hope for an existence beyond bodily death.The symbolic vehicle Burroughs uses here is ancient Egyptian mythology, a long-standing interest of his. ""The Western Lands"" of the title are the territory to which the Egyptians believed the souls of the dead made a hazardous pilgrimage in their quest for true immortality. The questers–Joe the Dead, Kim Carsons, the scribe Neferti, Hassan i Sabbah, the Old Man of the Mountain–travel through an unmistakably Burroughs-esque universe of appalling danger and otherworldly beauty–now the back alleys of ancient Egypt, now bombed-out Berlin, now the Old West of the shootists. Their hallucinatory journeys express the author's belief that only through facing the most extreme dangers and testing the possibilities of biological mutation can man escape a dead-end world of blasted dreams and atomic finale. And presiding over all is the haunting figure of ""the old writer,"" who shares in the fate of his characters in being finally unable to write himself out of Time, and into Space.The Western Lands continues and extends one of the great literary odysseys of our time, adding to Burroughs's awesome literary style and black humor chilling touches of elegy and autobiography. It is at once Burroughs's most personal and most universal work, yet another masterwork from the reigning genius of the American literary avant-garde.",English,9780140094565,"['Fiction', 'Literature', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', '20th Century', 'American', 'American Fiction', 'Mythology']",[],Paperback,,258,Penguin Books,1988,1987,[],1887,"['734', '683', '357', '88', '25']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388701772l/257506.jpg,28,1,9.10

33540805-barbarians,"Barbarians: How The Baby Boomers, Immigration, and Islam Screwed my Generation",,Lauren Southern,3.71,"The values that built the west have been forgotten. Instead, millennials have been raised to hold hedonism above all. Whatever feels good goes. Freedoms and rights are things for legislators and judges to conjure out of thin air, not precious traditions forged in the crucible of history. Most millennials reject the nuclear family, and the religious values, that our culture was built on because they resemble some sort of “unenlightened” old world of responsibility and duty that millennials want no part in.  In short, squaring the truth about the West with the twisted values they’ve been brought up to swallow without complaint is not something that will be comfortable for many millennials. But I think that if not now, eventually most of them will take the plunge. Because deep down I think we know that what we’ve done is not empowering. Abandoning all guidance of our past and embracing hedonism and subjectivity was not some genius idea. Dismissing the guidance built for us over thousands and thousands of years in the form of gender roles, traditional lifestyles, hard work, objectivity, and cultural supremacy was, in fact, painfully stupid.  Because really, what have we got to show for it? Nothing but infinite license to put who and what we want in our bodies, while our freedoms to speak, to think, to dream, and to build get more limited every day. We’ve decided to fall backwards off the shoulders of giants, and that fall probably feels good, until you realize there’s going to be a “splat” at the end.  So with the ground of reality rushing up at them, more and more young people are clawing for anything to stop their feelings of personal, ethical, political, intellectual and artistic failure. And the rotted timber of progressivism is increasingly failing to break their fall. So eventually, they turn elsewhere.  And so, a steadily increasing number of millennials are finally beginning to wake up to the choice we face as a civilization, and to the value they’ve so long overlooked in traditional standards of morality and beauty. They are wondering: is modern culture really so great if it means we substitute Meghan Trainor for Mozart, Emma Sulkowicz for Da Vinci, or Bell Hooks for Plato? Is it really such a step forward that our civilization, which once shed both blood and ink debating Martin Luther’s 95 Theses, is now reduced to considering theses like VICE Magazine’s “Dear Straight Guys: It’s Time to Start Putting Things In Your Butt?” Is this all there is, or can we do better?  No, it isn’t, and yes, we can and must do better. Sure, it’ll be hard for us to dig ourselves out of the pit that the left-wing indoctrination and media machines has dug for everyone our age. But it’s work worth doing. Because right now, the world is on fire. And while my generation didn’t start the fire, with apologies to Billy Joel, I believe we have a chance to contain it, or even put it out.  But first we have to expose the frauds, liars, idiots, and above all, barbarians who threw gas on it. So without further ado, let’s get to naming those names.",English,B01MU30NB0,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Cultural', 'History', 'Islam', 'Far Right', 'American History', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Canada']",[],Kindle Edition,,82,,December 21st 2016,,[],957,"['344', '267', '166', '89', '91']",81.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1482346046l/33540805._SY475_.jpg,28,1,

Exploration, sudden wealth, unspeakable hardship, the golden chance to build a new life in a new land - all these are present in this saga of human aspiration.	This book is a colorful gallery of characters: heroes and rascals, adventurers and plodders, men who invaded and tamed or were tamed by what the geographers call the true Far West — California, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado. In the cast are Spaniards, Russians, Yankees, Southerners; Sutter, whose dream of an idyllic retreat in the foothills of paradise was shattered by the Gold Rush; John C. Fremont, Mark Twain, Brigham Young, Ralston’s Ring and the Big Four; the Silver Kings, H. A.W. Tabor and Baby Doe, the Rose of Sharon and Eilley Orrum, and scores more. There were the Mormons who tamed the desert with Bible texts, polygamy and co-operation; miners who played wild melodramas in Nevada’s Comstock Lode and Colorado’s awesome Rockies; the tragic Donner Party; gun-toting newspapermen and bankers; and some of the world’s most fascinating women.	There were men who went West to fight, to make millions (or lose them), to die famous, infamous, or unknown; men who built colonies, railroads, cities, financial empires, or dreamed and struggled and failed.

Kennedy-most would agree their presidencies were among the most successful in American history. But what made these very different men such effective leaders? According to presidential historian Gil Troy, these presidents succeeded not because of their bold political visions, but because of their moderation. Although many of the presidential hopefuls for 2008 will claim to be moderates, the word cannot conceal a political climate defined by extreme rhetoric and virulent partisanship. In Leading From the Center, Gil Troy argues that this is a distinctly un-American state of affairs. The great presidents of American history have always sought a golden mean-from Washington, who brilliantly mediated between the competing visions of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, to Lincoln, who rescued the Union with his principled pragmatism, to the two Roosevelts, who united millions of Americans with their powerful, affirmative, nationalist visions.

Focusing on the rise of the mechanistic idea that we can know the natural world only by distancing ourselves from it, Berman shows how science acquired its controlling position in the consciousness of the West. He analyzes the holistic, animistic tradition--destroyed in the wake of Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries--which viewed man as a participant in the cosmos, not as an isolated observer. Arguing that the holistic world view must be revived in some credible form before we destroy our society and our environment, he explores the possibilities for a consciousness appropriate to the modern era. Ecological rather than animistic, this new world view would be grounded in the real and intimate connection between man and nature.--Chip Brown, The List",English,9780801492259,"['Philosophy', 'Science', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Ecology', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural', 'Politics']",[],Paperback,,368,Cornell University Press,November 30th 1981,January 1st 1981,[],203,"['90', '66', '35', '10', '2']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347699438l/486977.jpg,27,1,11.04

The HomeGround anthology includes material inspired by all periods of Kate Bush's musical progression. It is a book about the reaction to her work and how her unique music has touched the lives of so many people.This is a unique book, a labour of love for hundreds of music fans who have contributed to HomeGround over its thirty-year existence. The book includes an enormous amount of information about Kate Bush, as well as memories and accounts of music fandom. It features poetry, stories, letters, reviews, interviews, memoirs, cartoons, drawings, paintings and photographs.This is the first book of a two volume set. The first book covers Kate Bush's career from 'Wuthering Heights' to 'The Sensual World' (from the late 1970s to the late 1980s).The first issue of HomeGround appeared in 1982, four years after Kate Bush's dramatic debut with 'Wuthering Heights'. Starting with an ancient manual typewriter, and a pot of genuine paste, the editors mounted articles on recycled backing sheets and added hand-drawn artwork to fill the gaps. The first issue was photocopied, the pages hand-stapled together and twenty-five copies were given away to fans they knew. Only later did they discover the magic of word processing, and desktop publishing.From those beginnings HomeGround became a cornerstone of the 'Kate-speaking world', the editors going on to organise four official fan events at which Kate Bush and members of her family and band appeared, arrange at Bush's request a team of fans to be extras in two of her videos and organise informal fan gatherings at Glastonbury and Top Withens, the storm-blown ruin on Haworth Moor. Years before the internet, HomeGround became a place where fans could discuss Bush's music, and a place where they could publish creative writing and artwork that music inspired.Fully illustrated.

13590683-the-catcher-in-the-rye-and-philosophy,The Catcher in the Rye and Philosophy,Popular Culture and Philosophy #71,"Keith Dromm (Editor), Heather Salter (Editor)",3.54,"Few novels have had more influence on individuals and literary culture than J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye. Published in 1951 and intended by Salinger for adults (early drafts were published in the New Yorker and Colliers), the novel quickly became championed by youth who identified with the awkwardness and alienation of the novel’s protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Since then the book and its reclusive author have been fixtures of both popular and literary culture. Catcher is perhaps the only modern novel that is revered equally by the countless Americans whom Holden Caulfield helped through high school and puberty and literary critics (such as the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik who insisted as recently as 2010 that Catcher is a ""perfect"" twentieth-century novel).One premise of The Catcher in the Rye and Philosophy is that the ease and sincerity with which readers identify with Holden Caulfield rests on Salinger’s attention to the nuances and qualities of experience in the modern world. Coupled with Salinger’s deft subjective, first-person style, Holden comes to seem more real than any fictional character should. This and other paradoxes raised by the novel are treated by authors who find answers in philosophy, particularly in twentieth-century phenomenology and existentialism--areas of philosophy that share Salinger’s attention to lived, as opposed to theorized, experience. Holden’s preoccupation with “phonies,” along with his constant striving to interpret and judge the motives and beliefs of those around him, also taps into contemporary interest in philosophical theories of justice and Harry Frankfurt’s recently celebrated analysis of ""bullshit.""Per Salinger’s request, Catcher has never been made into a movie. One measure of the devotion and fanatical interest Catcher continues to inspire, however, is speculation in blogs and magazines about whether movie rights may become available in the wake of Salinger’s death in 2010. These articles remain purely hypothetical, but the questions they inspire--Who would direct? And, especially, Who would star as Holden Caulfield?--are as vivid and real as Holden himself.",English,9780812698008,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction']",[],Paperback,,288,Open Court,October 9th 2012,,[],35,"['7', '13', '8', '6', '1']",80.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344743080l/13590683.jpg,27,1,8.57

245705.Peter_the_First,Peter the First,,Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy,4.17,"Here, for the first time, in its final form and in a new translation, is the epic Russian novel which has sold in its native country over two million copies. Alexey Tolstoy (who was not related to the author of War and Peace) began to study the character of his hero, Peter the First, in 1917. When he died almost thirty years later, Tolstoy was still working on his masterpiece, this huge historical canvas which gives brilliant life and meaning to a crucial period in Russian history. Tolstoy reanimates the past by a succession of character creations which range from the serf, Ivan Brodkin, to Peter's sinister and opportunistic favorite, Alexander Menshikoff; from the old Boyars shorn of their beards and their prerogatives to the foreign captains of the new Russian navy. Here in these pages are the beautiful Anna Mons, Peter's first mistress; his wife Eudoxia, whom he never loved; and the peasant girl who eventually was to be crowned Empress Catherine the First. We see these men and women moving across a tapestry of battles abroad, and amid the dark, opulent luxury of the great families and the Imperial Court. In Tolstoy's moving crowded pages we see the emergence of Russia, thrust forward by Peter's inexorable will, from a backward medieval state to her final position as one of the great powers of Europe. Here are magnificent portraits, the fruits of years of historical research, of Peter's principal opponents: August, Elector of Saxony, indefatigable in his amusements, and King Charles XII of Sweden, a great military genius, flawed by passion and indulgence. But the true hero of Tolstoy's epic is Peter himself. We see him grow to be a man---awkward, suspicious, prone to spasms of cowardice, but always driving, sometimes provoked almost to madness, to free his country from the chains of backwardness and superstition to take her place as an equal among the nations of the west. And in the last analysis it is this greatness and originality of character in its hero which gives the stamp of greatness to the book itself. Alexey Tolstoy was born in 1883. In 1918 he published his first full length work, Nikita's Childhood. In 1919 he fled from the Bolshevik government and settled in Paris. In 1922 he asked for and received permission to return home. For the next twenty-four years he lived in Russia, until his death in 1946.",English,9781410225092,"['History', 'Classics', 'Russia', 'Russian Literature', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Russian History', 'Literature', 'Nonfiction', '18th Century']",[],Paperback,,776,University Press of the Pacific,October 1st 2005,1944,['Сталинская премия for Художественная проза (первая степень) (1940)'],2142,"['985', '683', '355', '83', '36']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388344415l/245705.jpg,27,1,

So if you like a contemporary romance with seven bishonens (beautiful/hot male) heroes pursuing one pretty young woman with all the love, angst, and drama that you’d expected from this genre, then this is the book for you. One young woman.Seven brothers.When she falls in love with two,which brother will she choose?In Japan, Sakura is the beautiful cherry blossom that blooms vibrantly in spring and symbolizes the insightful Buddhist phrase ono no aware, which means the pathos of things, a metaphor for the ephemeral nature of life. FALLING FOR SAKURA is the story of Caucasian-Japanese Sakura, her journey to finding herself, and her torn love for two very different brothers, Sebastian and Darcy Princeton.Orphan Sakura, with no last name, is accustomed to being rejected, hated, bullied, and unloved. When she is adopted by the wealthy Princeton family, her seven brothers refuse to accept her, and her two sisters constantly bully her. Instead of admitting defeat, she gladly takes on her new life with a brave face, working hard to earn her new siblings’ trust and love. Her endeavor, however, ultimately leads to a series of unfortunate incidents.Now years later, the twenty-three-year-old beauty dreads the moment she once again has to meet the drop-dead gorgeous brothers, due to arrive for their cousin’s wedding. Dodging their very presence is next to impossible since the brothers, who have forgotten who she is entirely, are attracted to her like moths to a flame and thwart her escapes at every turn. This, of course, leads to ungodly, tempting situations, awakens forbidden feelings, and ignites old flames that have been suppressed and laid dormant for many years. When she finds them competing for her—NOT for her sisterly affection, which she still deeply craves, but for her love as a woman—she is torn between Sebastian Princeton, the brother who loves her and watches over her from a distance, and Darcy Princeton, the brother who was once her best friend and now secretly yearns for her forgiveness and her love once again.",English,9999999999999,"['Reverse Harem', 'Romance', 'New Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Amazon', 'Harem', 'Young Adult', 'Erotica', 'Abuse']",[],Paperback,,,,,May 24th 2014,[],1339,"['520', '354', '262', '107', '96']",85.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401411334l/22373734.jpg,27,1,

6437544-the-bolter,The Bolter,,Frances Osborne,3.7,"She was irresistible. She inspired fiction, fantasy, legend, and art.Some say she was “the Bolter” of Nancy Mitford’s novel The Pursuit of Love. She “played” Iris Storm in Michael Arlen’s celebrated novel about fashionable London’s lost generation, The Green Hat, and Greta Garbo played her in A Woman of Affairs, the movie made from Arlen’s book. She was painted by Orpen; photographed by Beaton; she was the model for Molyneaux’s slinky wraparound dresses that became the look fo the age—the Jazz Age.Though not conventionally beautiful (she had a “shot-away chin”), Idina Sackville dazzled men and women alike, and made a habit of marrying whenever she fell in love—five husbands in all and lovers without number.Hers was the age of bolters, and Idina was the most celebrated of them all.Her father was the eighth Earl De La Warr. In a society that valued the antiquity of families and their money, hers was as old as a British family could be (eight hundred years earlier they had followed William the Conqueror from Normandy and been given enough land to live on forever . . . another ancestor, Lord De La Warr, rescued the starving Jamestown colonists in 1610, became governor of Virginia, and gave his name to the state of Delaware). Her mother’s money came from “trade”; Idina’s maternal grandfather had employed more men (85,000) than the British army and built one third of the world’s railroads.Idina’s first husband was a dazzling cavalry officer, one of the youngest, richest, and best-looking of the available bachelors, with “two million in cash.” They had a seven-story pied-à-terre on Connaught Place overlooking Marble Arch and Hyde Park, as well as three estates in Scotland. Idina had everything in place for a magnificent life, until the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand caused the newlyweds’ world—the world they’d assumed would last forever—to collapse in less than a year.Like Mitford’s Bolter, young Idina Sackville left her husband and children. But in truth it was her husband who wrecked their marriage, making Idina more a boltee than a bolter. Soon she found a lover of her own—the first of many—and plunged into a Jazz Age haze of morphine. She became a full-blown flapper, driving about London in her Hispano-Suiza, and pusing the boundaries of behavior to the breaking point. British society amy have adored eccentrics whose differences celebrated the values they cherished, but it did not embrace those who upset the order of things. And in 1918, just after the Armistice was signed, Idina Sackville bolted from her life in England and, setting out with her second husband, headed for Mombasa, in search of new adventure.Frances Osborne deftly tells the tale of her great-grandmother using Idina’s never-before-seen letters; the diaries of Idina’s first husband, Euan Wallace; and stories from family members. Osborne follows Idina from the champagne breakfasts and thé dansants of lost-generation England to the foothills of Kenya’s Aberdare moutnains and the wild abandon of her role in Kenya’s disintegration postwar upper-class life. A parade of lovers, a murdered husband, chaos everywhere—as her madcap world of excess darkened and crumbled around her.",English,9780307270146,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Africa', 'Kenya', 'Biography Memoir', 'British Literature', 'Historical', 'Memoir', 'Womens']",[],Hardcover,,300,Knopf,June 2nd 2009,January 1st 2008,[],3776,"['796', '1492', '1122', '288', '78']",90.0,"['Wanjohi Valley, Kenya']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320533098l/6437544.jpg,27,1,5.28

7631912-ayako,Ayako,Ayako #1-3,"Osamu Tezuka, Mari Morimoto (Translator)",3.93,"Long considered as one of Osamu Tezuka’s most political narratives, Ayako is also considered to be one of his most challenging as it defies the conventions of his manga by utilizing a completely original cast and relying solely on historical drama to drive the plot.  Ayako, pulls no punches, and does not allow for gimmicks as science-fiction or fantasy may.  Instead Tezuka weaves together a tale which its core simply focuses on a single family, a family that could be considered a metaphor for a rapidly developing superpower.Overflowing with imagery of the cold war seen through Japan’s eyes, Ayako is firmly set in realism taking inspiration from a number of historical events that occurred over the American occupation and the cultural-revolution which soon followed. Believed to be Tezuka’s answer to the gekiga (dramatic comics) movement of the 60’s, Ayako should be considered one of the better early examples of a seinen (young adult) narrative to be published.Initially set in the aftermath of World War II, Ayako focuses its attention on the Tenge clan, a once powerful family of landowners living in a rural community in northern Japan.  From the moment readers are introduced to the extended family, it is apparent that the war and American occupation have begun to erode the fabric that binds them all together.  The increasing influence of political, economic and social change begins to tear into the many Tenge siblings, while a strange marriage agreement creates resentment between the eldest son and his sire.  And when the family seems to have completely fallen apart, they decide to turn their collective rage on what they believe to be the source of their troubles—the newest member of the Tenge family, the youngest sister Ayako.",English,9781934287514,"['Manga', 'Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Japan', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Japanese Literature', 'Seinen', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Asia']",[],Hardcover,,704,Vertical,November 30th 2010,,[],1468,"['457', '584', '317', '90', '20']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358020666l/7631912.jpg,27,1,26.02

398868.Memoirs_Of_General_William_T_Sherman,Memoirs Of General William T. Sherman,,William T. Sherman,4.13,"William Tecumseh Sherman has been called the first modern general. According to military historian B. H. Liddell Hart, he understood before his contemporaries that wars and battles would be won ”more by the movement of troops than by fighting.” Also modern is his unsentimental view of combat, epitomized by his famous remark that ”War is hell.” And he was an able enough historian to realize that the Civil War—and indeed all future wars—would be unlike anything the world had ever seen: a bitter national struggle between free people that would involve a campaign of terror against combatant and non-combatant alike.His Memoirs, which rank with Grant's as the greatest of the Civil War, concern for the most part the strategy and fighting at Bull Run, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Atlanta, and of course the march through Georgia which earned Sherman his reputation for ruthlessness. It is a story packed with incident as well as swift sketches of his opponents, subordinates, and superiors, and it is endlessly instructive about the lessons of the war. Most of all, it is a compelling narrative about a national tragedy.",English,9780306802133,"['History', 'Civil War', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'American History', 'War', 'American Civil War', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir']",['William Tecumseh Sherman'],Paperback,,832,Da Capo Press,March 21st 1984,1886,[],1774,"['751', '643', '278', '66', '36']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1174432147l/398868.jpg,27,1,7.02

This explanation of the Book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible, demonstrates clearly and powerfully that the opposite is true. The Bible remains profoundly relevant—both to the great issues of our day and to each individual life. It is the greatest moral guide and source of wisdom ever written.  Do you doubt the existence of God because you think believing in God is irrational? This book will give you many reasons to rethink your doubts. Do you think faith and science are in conflict? You won’t after reading this commentary on Genesis. Do you come from a dysfunctional family? It may comfort you to know that every family discussed in Genesis was highly dysfunctional!  The title of this commentary is “The Rational Bible” because its approach is entirely reason-based. The reader is never asked to accept anything on faith alone. In Dennis Prager’s words, “If something I write is not rational, I have not done my job.”  The Rational Bible is the fruit of Dennis Prager’s forty years of teaching the Bible—whose Hebrew grammar and vocabulary he has mastered—to people of every faith and no faith at all.

245715.Aelita,Aelita,,Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy,3.64,"Tolstoi published two science fiction novels, both of which appeared in the experimental 1920s and which were revised during the following decades of Stalinist terror. Aelita (1923) is a science-fiction fantasy in the manner of H.G. Wells, telling the story of a Soviet expedition to Mars with the aim of establishing communism. A Red Army officer forments a rebellion of the native Martians, who are in fact long-ago emigrants from Atlantis. The story was adapted into a screen play in 1924. Its futuristic, expressionistic sets were designed by Isaac Rabinovitch of the Kamerny Theatre. The film influenced the design in Flash Gordon, a space opera, which was created by the artist Alex Raymond in 1934 and led to a popular radio serial and several films.

Two aviators—Jack Alcock and Arthur Brown—set course for Ireland as they attempt the first nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean, placing their trust in a modified bomber to heal the wounds of the Great War.Dublin, 1845 and '46. On an international lecture tour in support of his subversive autobiography, Frederick Douglass finds the Irish people sympathetic to the abolitionist cause—despite the fact that, as famine ravages the countryside, the poor suffer from hardships that are astonishing even to an American slave.New York, 1998. Leaving behind a young wife and newborn child, Senator George Mitchell departs for Belfast, where it has fallen to him, the son of an Irish-American father and a Lebanese mother, to shepherd Northern Ireland's notoriously bitter and volatile peace talks to an uncertain conclusion.These three iconic crossings are connected by a series of remarkable women whose personal stories are caught up in the swells of history. Beginning with Irish housemaid Lily Duggan, who crosses paths with Frederick Douglass, the novel follows her daughter and granddaughter, Emily and Lottie, and culminates in the present-day story of Hannah Carson, in whom all the hopes and failures of previous generations live on. From the loughs of Ireland to the flatlands of Missouri and the windswept coast of Newfoundland, their journeys mirror the progress and shape of history.

With vivid and touching detail, it recalls Weeratunge’s life, home, and family in her native village of Depanama on the island of Sri Lanka. Weeratunge’s memories reveal a yearning for past times when traditions like celebrating the New Year or a Full Moon Day, still endured. Her poignant reminiscences evoke compassion for a misunderstood vagrant and a captive elephant, and curiosity for the appearance of the Pot-Bellied Merchant and Uncle Robert the Capitalist. She celebrates everyday heroes like the Coconut-Plucker, the Cook of Sweet Meats, and the Buffalo-Herdsman. With delicate diplomacy, cultural change is signaled by events such as the abandoning of the firewood hearth and the arrival of the television. These intricately woven stories are told with an engaging voice and graceful prose. Time, as it often does, has softened the edges and imparted a gentle humor in each vignette, whether in describing a rice harvest or sharing a game of checkers on the veranda.

124432.White_Mughals,White Mughals: Love and Betrayal in Eighteenth-Century India,,William Dalrymple,3.93,"White Mughals is the romantic and ultimately tragic tale of a passionate love affair that crossed and transcended all the cultural, religious and political boundaries of its time. James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Kahir un-Nissa—'Most excellent among Women'—the great-niece of the Nizam's Prime Minister and a descendant of the Prophet. Kirkpatrick had gone out to India as an ambitious soldier in the army of the East India Company, eager to make his name in the conquest and subjection of the subcontinent. Instead, he fell in love with Khair and overcame many obstacles to marry her—not least of which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to Islam, and according to Indian sources even became a double-agent working for the Hyderabadis against the East India Company.It is a remarkable story, involving secret assignations, court intrigue, harem politics, religious and family disputes. But such things were not unknown; from the early sixteenth century, when the Inquisition banned the Portuguese in Goa from wearing the dhoti, to the eve of the Indian mutiny, the 'white Mughals' who wore local dress and adopted Indian ways were a source of embarrassments to successive colonial administrations. William Dalrymple unearths such colourful figures as 'Hindoo Stuart', who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and who spent many years trying to persuade the memsahibs of Calcutta to adopt the sari; and Sir David Ochterlony, Kirkpatrick's counterpart in Delhi, who took all thirteen of his wives out for evening promenades, each on the back of their own elephant.In White Mughals, William Dalrymple discovers a world almost entirely unexplored by history, and places at its centre a compelling tale of love, seduction and betrayal. It possesses all the sweep and resonance of a great nineteenth-century novel, set against a background of shifting alliances and the manoeuvring of the great powers, the mercantile ambitions of the British and the imperial dreams of Napoleon. White Mughals, the product of five years' writing and research, triumphantly confirms Dalrymple's reputation as one of the finest writers at work today.",English,9780142004128,"['History', 'India', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'Travel', 'Asia', '18th Century', 'Indian Literature', 'British Literature']",[],Paperback,,580,Penguin Books,April 27th 2004,March 29th 2002,"['Wolfson History Prize (2003)', 'Kiriyama Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2004)', 'Hessell-Tiltman Prize Nominee (2003)']",4091,"['1239', '1676', '900', '210', '66']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309285574l/124432.jpg,26,1,5.57

Communities, societies, nations, and even entire continents, the book suggests, exist not autonomously but rather in a densely woven web of connectedness.To explore this complexity, the editors have forged links between usually compartmentalized fields (especially media studies, literary theory, visual culture, and critical anthropology) and areas of inquiry-particularly postcolonial and diasporic studies and a diverse set of ethnic and area studies. This book, which links all these issues in suggestive ways, provides an indispensable guide for students and scholars in a wide variety of disciplines. Essays in this groundbreaking volume include Julianne Burton-Carvajal on ethnic identity in Lone Star; Manthia Diawara on diasporic documentary; Hamid Naficy on independent transnational film genres; Robyn Wiegman on whiteness studies; Faye Ginsburg on indigenous media; and Jennifer Gonzßles on race in cyberspace; Ana M.

Do you doubt the existence of God because belief in God is “irrational?” This book will give you reason after reason to rethink your doubts.

As Prager says, “If something I write does not make rational sense, I have not done my job.” The Rational Bible is the fruit of Dennis Prager’s forty years of teaching the Bible to people of every faith, and no faith.

Elena is forced to wed the head of the Celano clan, a jealous, brutal man, while Marietta marries Domenico Torrisi, whose family vendetta with the Celanos is centuries old. Tradition dictates that the friends should never speak again, but their bond is too strong to break.

1471781.Papa_Married_A_Mormon,Papa Married A Mormon,,John D. Fitzgerald,4.18,"Papa Married a Mormon made its initial appearance in McCall's magazine in 1955 and later became a bestseller for Prentice-Hall and a selection of two book clubs. Mamma's Boarding House and Uncle Will and the Fitzgerald Curse followed soon after, but good luck finding either of them.Born in Price, Utah, in 1907 to a Scandinavian Mormon mother and an Irish Catholic father, he grew up influenced by both cultures. He left Utah behind at age eighteen, working at such varied jobs as playing in a jazz band, working in a bank, and serving as an overseas newspaper correspondent. At the time of his first break into the national literary scene, he was a purchaser for a steel company in California. Fitzgerald began writing Papa Married a Mormon, a family history about his boyhood, to fulfill a promise made to his mother on her death-bed. She implored him to tell the story of those who settled the west. Not so much a story of the Mormons, but of the people themselves – specifically Fitzgerald’s family and members of the Mormon/Gentile community in which they lived.Set in the fictional southern Utah community of Adenville, Fitzgerald creates a nostalgic picture of small town life in early 1900s. The story tells of the conflicts between the Mormons and gentiles within the community, and how leaders on both sides managed to unify the town, despite their differences and animosities. Because many parts of the book are similar in prose to Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn novels, Papa Married a Mormon fits the mold of a Victorian look at an era long gone.Reference: The Promise Is Fulfilled: Literary Aspects of John D.

Teaming up with longtime friends -- NYPD's Mike Chapman and Mercer Wallace -- Assistant DA Alex Cooper investigates the disappearance of world-famous dancer Natalya Galinova, who has suddenly vanished backstage at Lincoln Center's Metropolitan Opera House -- during a performance.  The three colleagues are soon drawn into the machinations of New York City's secretive theatrical community, where ambition takes many forms, including those most deadly. Among Galinova's lovers is Joe Berk, the colorful, strong-willed boss of the Berk Organization, one of four family companies that own all the legitimate theaters on Broadway. The aging ballerina was using Berk to help revive her career at the time of her disappearance.  Cooper, Chapman, and Wallace go underground and backstage at the Met, explore Berk's unusual apartment on top of the Belasco Theatre with its rumored ghostly resident, and then discover bizarre circumstances at City Center, which has a peculiar history not one of them knew about until now.  Within the glamorous but sordid inner sanctums of the Broadway elite, the team confronts the ruthless power brokers who control both the stars and the stages where they appear. They meet Joe's niece Mona Berk, who is mounting a vicious campaign to extract her share of the family fortune, and stunning starlet Lucy DeVore, whose beauty may be her fatal undoing. Chet Dobbis is the artistic director of the Metropolitan Opera, and therefore privy to the most scandalous exploits among its famous inhabitants.

Complicating her quest is the explosive legal and ethical dilemma of using the existing DNA databank to solve new cases. Can Alex convince a judge to let her prosecute a man for a violent crime using DNA that was collected for a prior case in which he was never charged? Or do the suspect's civil rights prevent law enforcement from keeping his DNA on file to be used against him at any future time?

178658.The_Making_of_New_World_Slavery,The Making of New World Slavery: From the Baroque to the Modern 1492-1800,,Robin Blackburn,3.79,"At the time when European powers colonized the Americas, the institution of slavery had almost disappeared from Europe itself. Having overcome an institution widely regarded as oppressive, why did they sponsor the construction of racial slavery in their new colonies?Robin Blackburn traces European doctrines of race and slavery from medieval times to the early modern epoch, and finds that the stigmatization of the ethno-religious Other was given a callous twist by a new culture of consumption, freed from an earlier moral economy.The Making of New World Slavery argues that independent commerce, geared to burgeoning consumer markets, was the driving force behind the rise of plantation slavery. The baroque state sought—successfully—to batten on this commerce, and—unsuccessfully—to regulate slavery and race. Successive chapters of the book consider the deployment of slaves in the colonial possessions of the Portuguese, the Spanish, the Dutch, the English and the French. Each are shown to have contributed something to the eventual consolidation of racial slavery and to the plantation revolution of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is shown that plantation slavery emerged from the impulses of civil society rather than from the strategies of the individual states.Robin Blackburn argues that the organization of slave plantations placed the West on a destructive path to modernity and that greatly preferable alternatives were both proposed and rejected. Finally he shows that the surge of Atlantic trade, premised on the killing toil of the plantations, made a decisive contribution to both the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the West.",English,9781859841952,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'World History', 'Race', 'European History', 'American History', 'Latin American History']",[],Paperback,,608,Verso,May 17th 1998,1997,['Isaac Deutscher Memorial Prize (1997)'],103,"['31', '32', '29', '9', '2']",89.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347646195l/178658.jpg,25,1,26.73

20663692-quartet-for-the-end-of-time,Quartet for the End of Time,,Johanna Skibsrud,2.63,"Inspired by and structured around the chamber piece of the same title by the French composer Olivier Messiaen, Quartet for the End of Time is a mesmerizing story of four lives irrevocably linked in a single act of betrayal. The novel takes us on an unforgettable journey beginning during the 1930s Bonus Army riots, when World War I veteran Arthur Sinclair is falsely accused of conspiracy and then disappears. His absence will haunt his son, Douglas, as well as Alden and Sutton Kelly, the children of a powerful U.S. congressman, as they experience—each in different ways—the dynamic political social changes that took place leading up to and during World War II.From the New Deal projects through which Douglas, newly fatherless, makes his living to Sutton’s work as a journalist, to Alden’s life as a code breaker and a spy, each character is haunted by the past and is searching for love, hope, and redemption in a world torn apart by chaos and war. Through the lives of these characters, as well as those of their lovers, friends, and enemies, the novel transports us from the Siberian Expedition of World War I to the underground world of a Soviet spy in the 1920s and 1930s, to the occultist circle of P. D. Ouspensky and London during the Blitz, to the German prison camp where Messiaen originally composed and performed his famous Quartet for the End of Time.At every turn, this rich and ambitious novel tells some of the less well-known stories of twentieth-century history with epic scope and astonishing power, revealing at every turn the ways in which history and memory tend to follow us, and in which absence has a palpable presence.",en,9780393073737,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Music', 'Literature']",[],Hardcover,,480,W.

13153931-full-body-burden,Full Body Burden: Growing Up in the Nuclear Shadow of Rocky Flats,,Kristen Iversen (Goodreads Author),4.02,"Full Body Burden is a haunting work of narrative nonfiction about a young woman, Kristen Iversen, growing up in a small Colorado town close to Rocky Flats, a secret nuclear weapons plant once designated ""the most contaminated site in America."" It's the story of a childhood and adolescence in the shadow of the Cold War, in a landscape at once startlingly beautiful and—unknown to those who lived there—tainted with invisible yet deadly particles of plutonium.It's also a book about the destructive power of secrets—both family and government. Her father's hidden liquor bottles, the strange cancers in children in the neighborhood, the truth about what was made at Rocky Flats (cleaning supplies, her mother guessed)—best not to inquire too deeply into any of it.But as Iversen grew older, she began to ask questions. She learned about the infamous 1969 Mother's Day fire, in which a few scraps of plutonium spontaneously ignited and—despite the desperate efforts of firefighters—came perilously close to a ""criticality,"" the deadly blue flash that signals a nuclear chain reaction. Intense heat and radiation almost melted the roof, which nearly resulted in an explosion that would have had devastating consequences for the entire Denver metro area. Yet the only mention of the fire was on page 28 of the Rocky Mountain News, underneath a photo of the Pet of the Week. In her early thirties, Iversen even worked at Rocky Flats for a time, typing up memos in which accidents were always called ""incidents.""And as this memoir unfolds, it reveals itself as a brilliant work of investigative journalism—a detailed and shocking account of the government's sustained attempt to conceal the effects of the toxic and radioactive waste released by Rocky Flats, and of local residents' vain attempts to seek justice in court. Here, too, are vivid portraits of former Rocky Flats workers—from the healthy, who regard their work at the plant with pride and patriotism, to the ill or dying, who battle for compensation for cancers they got on the job.Based on extensive interviews, FBI and EPA documents, and class-action testimony, this taut, beautifully written book promises to have a very long half-life.",English,9780307955630,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Science', 'Biography', 'Environment', 'Politics', 'Health', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook']",[],Hardcover,,416,Crown,June 5th 2012,January 1st 2012,"['Colorado Book Award for General Nonfiction (2013)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2013)']",3121,"['1011', '1342', '627', '111', '30']",95.0,['Colorado (United States)'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332528768l/13153931.jpg,25,1,3.28

An Area of Darkness also abounds with Naipaul’s strikingly original responses to India’s paralyzing caste system, its apparently serene acceptance of poverty and squalor, and the conflict between its desire for self-determination and its nostalgia for the British raj.

But this is my story, and it has a beginning, a middle, and an end….”The Open Door is a luminous and profoundly moving novel inspired by the life of Constance Fenimore Woolson, one of the most widely-read and respected American authors of the nineteenth century. Exploring themes of passion, life, death, friendship, and art, the novel is a vivid evocation of the complex forces behind literary creation.After years of supporting her mother and a hapless brother through her writing, Constance finds herself in early middle age “hungry, ravenous to see and live as much as possible.” She sails for Europe with a letter of introduction to Henry James, the writer she admires above all others. Constance is intoxicated by Europe, Italy in particular, and she and James eventually meet in Florence. James is delighted by this highly intelligent, independent woman (whom he dubs “Fenimore” as a sign of his esteem) and makes her his confidante. For her part, Constance finds with James “the unequalled joy of never running out of things to say.”Constance’s courageous, open nature is odds with James’s more secretive one and inevitably leads to friction, transgression, and revenge both private and public. Elegantly conceived and life-affirming, The Open Door is an unforgettable portrait of a remarkable woman who lived with passion and refused to accept the narrowing of her world.",English,9781590512838,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Books About Books', 'Adult Fiction']",[],Hardcover,,236,Other Press,June 10th 2008,2008,[],139,"['23', '37', '57', '16', '6']",84.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320530520l/2728741.jpg,25,1,4.83

When it flew overhead, it left in its wake desolate cold and frozen land. But Adara was not afraid. For Adara was a winter child, born during the worst freeze that anyone, even the Old Ones, could remember. Adara could not remember the first time she had seen the ice dragon. It seemed that it had always been in her life, glimpsed from afar as she played in the frigid snow long after the other children had fled the cold. In her fourth year she touched it, and in her fifth year she rode upon its broad, chilled back for the first time. Then, in her seventh year, on a calm summer day, fiery dragons from the North swooped down upon the peaceful farm that was Adara's home. And only a winter child--and the ice dragon who loved her--could save her world from utter destruction. ""The Ice Dragon"" marks the highly anticipated children's book debut of George R.R. Martin, the award-winning author of the ""New York Times"" best-selling series A Song of Ice and Fire and is set in the same world.

8607349-the-renegado,The Renegado,,"Philip Massinger, Michael Neill (Editor)",3.2,"The Renegado is one of the most shamelessly entertaining plays of its age, fetching its inspiration from a number of works by Cervantes, based on his own experiences as a captive in Algiers. Introducing the eroticized captivity narrative to the English stage, Massinger's tragicomedy combines it with the long-popular romance motif of a Christian hero's conquest of an exotic princess. But even as it indulges in romantic fantasy, The Renegado engages with contentious issues of national and international politics, offering a provocative response to the sectarian feuds dividing England in the 1620s, while exploiting wider European fears of the expansionist Muslim empire of the Ottomans. Through its treatment of religious confrontation and conversion, Massinger's play offers important insights into early modern constructions of the Islamic world, and emerges as a piece with unexpected resonances for our own time.This is the first major single-volume edition of The Renegado, making it properly available to all students and teachers of early modern drama. With detailed on-page commentary notes and an illustrated introduction assessing its impact on the Renaissance stage as well as its particular relevance to our contemporary multi-cultural society, it is a stimulating and original teaching edition.An extract from Cervantes' The Prisons of Algiers, a key source for the play, is given in an appendix and the whole Cervantes text is available on the Arden website as an additional resource.",English,9781904271611,"['Plays', 'Drama', 'Classics', 'Read For School', 'Theatre']",[],Paperback,,272,The Arden Shakespeare,May 1st 2010,,[],107,"['8', '29', '49', '18', '3']",80.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1315670178l/8607349.jpg,25,1,17.93

On New Year's Eve, hoping to impress his wife, he sneaks home the prototype. It brings no new warmth to their cooling relationship, but it does attract someone else's attention.When Joe sees a set of lips talking to him (floating in midair) and feels the poke of a disembodied finger (inside him), it's not because of the champagne he's drunk. He has just met Momo, a woman from the All, a world of four spatial dimensions for whom our narrow world, which she calls Spaceland, is something like a rug, but one filled with motion and life. Momo has a business proposition for Joe, an offer she won't let him refuse. The upside potential becomes much clearer to him once she helps him grow a new eye (on a stalk) that can see in the fourth-dimensional directions, and he agrees.After that it's a wild ride through a million-dollar night in Las Vegas, a budding addiction to tasty purple 4-D food, a failing marriage, eye-popping excursions into the All, and encounters with Momo's foes, rubbery red critters who steal money, offer sage advice and sometimes messily explode. Joe is having the time of his life, until Momo's scheme turns out to have angles he couldn't have imagined.

134244.Unto_Others,Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior,,"Elliott Sober, David Sloan Wilson",3.82,"No matter what we do, however kind or generous our deeds may seem, a hidden motive of selfishness lurks--or so science has claimed for years. This book, whose publication promises to be a major scientific event, tells us differently. In Unto Others philosopher Elliott Sober and biologist David Sloan Wilson demonstrate once and for all that unselfish behavior is in fact an important feature of both biological and human nature. Their book provides a panoramic view of altruism throughout the animal kingdom--from self-sacrificing parasites to insects that subsume themselves in the superorganism of a colony to the human capacity for selflessness--even as it explains the evolutionary sense of such behavior.Explaining how altruistic behavior can evolve by natural selection, this book finally gives credence to the idea of group selection that was originally proposed by Darwin but denounced as heretical in the 1960s. With their account of this controversy, Sober and Wilson offer a detailed case study of scientific change as well as an indisputable argument for group selection as a legitimate theory in evolutionary biology.Unto Others also takes a novel evolutionary approach in explaining the ultimate psychological motives behind unselfish human behavior. Developing a theory of the proximate mechanisms that most likely evolved to motivate adaptive helping behavior, Sober and Wilson show how people and perhaps other species evolved the capacity to care for others as a goal in itself.A truly interdisciplinary work that blends biology, philosophy, psychology, and anthropology, this book will permanently change not just our view of selfless behavior but also our understanding of many issues in evolutionary biology and the social sciences.",English,9780674930476,"['Psychology', 'Evolution', 'Philosophy', 'Science', 'Anthropology', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Sociology']",[],Paperback,,416,Harvard University Press,October 1st 1999,1998,[],91,"['23', '37', '23', '8', '0']",91.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347351180l/134244.jpg,25,1,30.12

24911006-missoula,Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town,,Jon Krakauer (Goodreads Author),4.08,"From bestselling author Jon Krakauer, a stark, powerful, meticulously reported narrative about a series of sexual assaults at the University of Montana ­— stories that illuminate the human drama behind the national plague of campus rape. Missoula, Montana, is a typical college town, with a highly regarded state university, bucolic surroundings, a lively social scene, and an excellent football team — the Grizzlies — with a rabid fan base.  The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012. Few of these assaults were properly handled by either the university or local authorities. In this, Missoula is also typical.  A DOJ report released in December of 2014 estimates 110,000 women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four are raped each year. Krakauer’s devastating narrative of what happened in Missoula makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault.  Acquaintance rape is a crime like no other. Unlike burglary or embezzlement or any other felony, the victim often comes under more suspicion than the alleged perpetrator. This is especially true if the victim is sexually active; if she had been drinking prior to the assault — and if the man she accuses plays on a popular sports team. The vanishingly small but highly publicized incidents of false accusations are often used to dismiss her claims in the press. If the case goes to trial, the woman’s entire personal life becomes fair game for defense attorneys.  This brutal reality goes a long way towards explaining why acquaintance rape is the most underreported crime in America. In addition to physical trauma, its victims often suffer devastating psychological damage that leads to feelings of shame, emotional paralysis and stigmatization. PTSD rates for rape victims are estimated to be 50%, higher than soldiers returning from war. In Missoula, Krakauer chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula — the nights when they were raped; their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the way they were treated by the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys; the public vilification and private anguish; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them. Some of them went to the police. Some declined to go to the police, or to press charges, but sought redress from the university, which has its own, non-criminal judicial process when a student is accused of rape. In two cases the police agreed to press charges and the district attorney agreed to prosecute. One case led to a conviction; one to an acquittal. Those women courageous enough to press charges or to speak publicly about their experiences were attacked in the media, on Grizzly football fan sites, and/or to their faces. The university expelled three of the accused rapists, but one was reinstated by state officials in a secret proceeding. One district attorney testified for an alleged rapist at his university hearing. She later left the prosecutor’s office and successfully defended the Grizzlies’ star quarterback in his rape trial. The horror of being raped, in each woman’s case, was magnified by the mechanics of the justice system and the reaction of the community. Krakauer’s dispassionate, carefully documented account of what these women endured cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape. College-age women are not raped because they are promiscuous, or drunk, or send mixed signals, or feel guilty about casual sex, or seek attention. They are the victims of a terrible crime and deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken.",English,9780385538732,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Feminism', 'Crime', 'Politics', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Journalism', 'Adult']",[],Hardcover,,368,Doubleday,April 21st 2015,,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2015)'],43607,"['15451', '19126', '6973', '1342', '715']",95.0,"['Missoula, Montana (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1491227618l/24911006._SY475_.jpg,25,1,5.24

This lush new novel tells the story behind one of the great tributes to romantic love and one of the seven wonders of the world -- the Taj Mahal.Mehrunnisa, better known as Empress Nur Jahan, comes into Jahangir's harem as his twentieth and last wife. Almost from the beginning of her royal life she fits none of the established norms of womanhood in seventeenth-century India.Mehrunnisa is the first woman Jahangir marries for love, at the ""old"" age of thirty-four. He loves her so deeply that he eventually transfers his powers of sovereignty to her.Power and wealth do not come easily to Mehrunnisa -- she has to fight for them. She has a formidable rival in the imperial harem, Empress Jagat Gosini, who has schemed and plotted against Mehrunnisa from early on. Mehrunnisa's problems do not just lie within the harem walls, but at court, too, as she battles powerful ministers for supremacy. These ministers, who have long had Emperor Jahangir's confidence and trust, consider Mehrunnisa a mere woman who cannot have a voice in the outside world.Mehrunnisa combats all of this by forming a junta of sorts with three men she can rely on -- her father, her brother, and Jahangir's son Prince Khurram. She demonstrates great strength of character and cunning to get what she wants, sometimes at a cost of personal sorrow when she almost loses her daughter's love.

5040449-george-sprott-1894-1975,"George Sprott, 1894-1975",,Seth,4.09,"
  First serialized in The New York Times Magazine “Funny Pages”The celebrated cartoonist and New Yorker illustrator Seth weaves the fictional tale of George Sprott, the host of a long-running television program. The events forming the patchwork of George’s life are pieced together from the tenuous memories of several informants, who often have contradictory impressions. His estranged daughter describes the man as an unforgivable lout, whereas his niece remembers him fondly. His former assistant recalls a trip to the Arctic during which George abandoned him for two months, while George himself remembers that trip as the time he began writing letters to a former love, from whom he never received replies.Invoking a sense of both memory and its loss, George Sprott is heavy with the charming, melancholic nostalgia that distinguishes Seth’s work. Characters lamenting societal progression in general share the pages with images of antiquated objects—proof of events and individuals rarely documented and barely remembered. Likewise, George’s own opinions are embedded with regret and a sense of the injustice of aging in this bleak reminder of the inevitable slipping away of lives, along with the fading culture of their days.

Its companion-piece, D'Alembert's Dream, outlines a material, atheistic view of the universe, expressed through the fevered dreams of Diderot's friend D'Alembert.

Indeed, no artistic movement has ever been quite so controversial.

6314637-10-10-10,10-10-10: A Life-Transforming Idea,,Suzy Welch,3.52,"Any choice you make - any decision - will benefit from 10-10-10. We all want to lead a life of our own making. But in today's accelerated world, with its competing priorities, information overload, and confounding options, we can easily find ourselves steered by impulse, stress, or expedience. Are our decisions the right ones? Or are we being governed, time and time again, and against our best intentions, by the demands of the moment? A transformative new approach to decision making, 10-10-10 is a tool for reclaiming your life at home, in love, and at work. The process is clear, straightforward, and transparent. In fact, when you're facing a dilemma, all it takes to begin are three questions: What are the consequences of my decision in 10 minutes? In 10 months? And in 10 years? Sound simple? Not quite. Recounting poignant stories from her own life and the lives of many other dedicated 10-10-10 users, Suzy Welch reveals how exploring the impact of our decisions in multiple time frames invariably surfaces our unconscious agendas, fears, needs, and desires — and ultimately helps us identify and live according to our deepest goals and values. 10-10-10's applicability is uniquely broad. Whether it is used by college students or busy mothers or senior business executives, artists, government administrators, or entrepreneurs, 10-10-10 has shown its effectiveness in decisions large and small, routine and radical, consistently changing lives for the better. Readers of ""O"" magazine discovered this pragmatic and innovative idea when Suzy Welch first introduced it in her column. Now, in this immensely useful and revelatory book, she fully explains the power of 10-10-10, a transformative idea that can replace chaos with consistency, guilt with joy, and confusion with clarity.",English,9781416591825,"['Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Relationships', 'Leadership', 'Audiobook', 'Health', 'Family']",[],Hardcover,,222,Scribner,April 14th 2009,2009,[],1340,"['296', '375', '459', '151', '59']",84.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347624000l/6314637.jpg,24,1,3.12

With the Earth groaning beneath the weight of 200 billion people and with the limit of derivable scientific knowledge frighteningly close at hand, scientists believe the human race will crash, burn and vanish by the end of the twenty-third century. The last hope of humanity travels with Captain Virginia Vonzell Qing-an, her androgynous lover, and eleven other crew members aboard Earth's first starship, Mother Night, on a colonizing mission to Alpha Centauri—the closest, most likely place to find worlds suitable for human habitation. It is the adventure of a lifetime, but plagued from the onset by programming errors, structural damage and irresponsible death. But a different kind of plague could doom the assignment and, ultimately, the civilization that conceived it. A terrorist group, Indigo, has infiltrated the ship—single-minded true believers convinced that the only cure for their world's population problems is rampant, viral-induced, sexually transmitted sterilization. And the stakes are about to reach astronomical proportions.

Yet this is the first book to tell the story of rain. Cynthia Barnett's  Rain begins four billion years ago with the torrents that filled the oceans, and builds to the storms of climate change. It weaves together science—the true shape of a raindrop, the mysteries of frog and fish rains—with the human story of our ambition to control rain, from ancient rain dances to the 2,203 miles of levees that attempt to straitjacket the Mississippi River. It offers a glimpse of our ""founding forecaster,"" Thomas Jefferson, who measured every drizzle long before modern meteorology. Two centuries later, rainy skies would help inspire Morrissey’s mopes and Kurt Cobain’s grunge. Rain is also a travelogue, taking readers to Scotland to tell the surprising story of the mackintosh raincoat, and to India, where villagers extract the scent of rain from the monsoon-drenched earth and turn it into perfume. Now, after thousands of years spent praying for rain or worshiping it; burning witches at the stake to stop rain or sacrificing small children to bring it; mocking rain with irrigated agriculture and cities built in floodplains; even trying to blast rain out of the sky with mortars meant for war, humanity has finally managed to change the rain. Only not in ways we intended. As climate change upends rainfall patterns and unleashes increasingly severe storms and drought, Barnett shows rain to be a unifying force in a fractured world. Too much and not nearly enough, rain is a conversation we share, and this is a book for everyone who has ever experienced it.",en,9780804137096,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Nature', 'Environment', 'Microhistory', 'Natural History', 'Audiobook', 'Travel', 'Unfinished']",[],Hardcover,,355,Crown Publishers,April 21st 2015,,"['National Book Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2015)', 'PEN/E.O.

116826.King_of_the_World,King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero,,David Remnick,4.27,"There were mythic sports figures before him--Jack Johnson, Babe Ruth, Joe Louis, Joe DiMaggio--but when Cassius Clay burst onto the sports scene from his native Louisville in the 1950s, he broke the mold. He changed the world of sports and went on to change the world itself. As Muhammad Ali, he would become the most recognized face on the planet. Ali was a transcendent athlete and entertainer, a heavyweight Fred Astaire, a rapper before rap was born. He was a mirror of his era, a dynamic figure in the racial and cultural battles of his time. This unforgettable story of his rise and self-creation, told by a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, places Ali in a heritage of great American originals. Cassius Clay grew up in the Jim Crow South and came of athletic age when boxers were at the mercy of the mob. From the start, Clay rebelled against everything and everyone who would keep him and his people down. He refused the old stereotypes and refused the glad hand of the mob. And, to the confusion and fury of white sportswriters, who were far more comfortable with the self-effacing Joe Louis, Clay came forward as a rebel, insistent on his political views, on his new religion, and, eventually, on a new name. His rebellion nearly cost him the chance to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world. King of the World features some of the pivotal figures of the 1960s--Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad, John F. Kennedy--and its pivotal events: the civil rights movement, political assassinations, the war in Vietnam. Muhammad Ali is a great hero and a beloved figure in American life. King of the World takes us back to the days when his life was a series of battles, inside the ring and out. A master storyteller at the height of his powers, David Remnick has written a book worthy of America's most dynamic modern hero.",English,9780330371896,"['Biography', 'Sports', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'African American', 'Biography Memoir', 'American', 'Politics', 'Memoir', 'The United States Of America']",['Muhammad Ali'],Paperback,,330,Picador,2000,1998,"['Independent Publisher Book Award (IPPY) Nominee for Audio Nonfiction (Finalist) (1999)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Biography/Autobiography (1998)']",3541,"['1541', '1509', '415', '59', '17']",98.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408309614l/116826.jpg,24,1,1.45

Darwin in Small-Town America,,Lauri Lebo,4.18,"Local newspaper reporter Lauri Lebo was handed the story of a lifetime when the Dover (Pennsylvania) School Board adopted a measure to require its ninth-grade biology students to learn about intelligent design. In a case that recalled the famed 1925 Scopes “monkey” trial and made international headlines, eleven parents sued the school board. When the case wound up in federal court before a George W. Bush–appointed judge, Lebo had a front-row seat.Destined to become required reading for a generation of journalists, scientists, and science teachers, as well as for anyone concerned about the separation of church and state, The Devil in Dover is Lebo’s widely praised account of a perfect storm of religious intolerance, First Amendment violations, and an assault on American science education. Lebo skillfully probes the compelling background of the case, introducing us to the plaintiffs, the defendants, the lawyers, and a parade of witnesses, along with Judge John E. Jones, who would eventually condemn the school board’s decision as one of “breathtaking inanity.”With the antievolution battle having moved to the state level—and the recent passage of state legislation that protects the right of schools to teach alternatives to evolution—the story will continue to be relevant for years to come.",English,9781595582089,"['Science', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Religion', 'Evolution', 'Education', 'Biology', 'Society']",[],Hardcover,,238,The New Press,May 13th 2008,,[],257,"['104', '106', '40', '3', '4']",97.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328751589l/2431812.jpg,24,1,3.24

The alien quarx that soon inhabits his mind is humanity’s first contact with an alien life—a contact Bandicut can reveal to no one. The quarx, part of an ancient galactic civilization that manipulates chaos theory to predict catastrophic events, seeks to prevent a cometary collision that could destroy the Earth.

His sister Heris and his living ancestor Cloven Februaren, the Ninth Unknown, have made Hecht part of their fight against the return of the dark god Kharoulke the Windwalker. At the same time, the half-mad Empress Katrin wants him to lead the armies of the Grail Empire eastward on a crusade against his old coreligionists the Praman.

159850.Victoria_Victorious,Victoria Victorious: The Story of Queen Victoria,Queens of England #3,Jean Plaidy,3.8,"In this unforgettable novel of Queen Victoria, Jean Plaidy re-creates a remarkable life filled with romance, triumph, and tragedy.At birth, Princess Victoria was fourth in line for the throne of England, the often-overlooked daughter of a prince who died shortly after her birth. She and her mother lived in genteel poverty for most of her childhood, exiled from court because of her mother's dislike of her uncles, George IV and William IV. A strong, willful child, Victoria was determined not to be stifled by her powerful uncles or her unpopular, controlling mother. Then one morning, at the age of eighteen, Princess Victoria awoke to the news of her uncle William's death. The almost-forgotten princess was now Queen of England. Even better, she was finally free of her mother's iron hand and her uncles' manipulations. Her first act as queen was to demand that she be given a room--and a bed--of her own.Victoria's marriage to her German cousin, Prince Albert, was a blissfully happy one that produced nine children. Albert was her constant companion and one of her most trusted advisors. Victoria's grief after Prince Albert's untimely death was so shattering that for the rest of her life--nearly forty years--she dressed only in black. She survived several assassination attempts, and during her reign England's empire expanded around the globe until it touched every continent in the world.Derided as a mere ""girl queen"" at her coronation, by the end of her sixty-four-year reign, Victoria embodied the glory of the British Empire. In this novel, written as a ""memoir"" by Victoria herself, she emerges as truthful, sentimental, and essentially human--both a lovable woman and a great queen.",English,9780609810248,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'British Literature', '19th Century', 'Victorian', 'Romance', 'Adult Fiction', 'Love', 'Chick Lit']",['Queen Victoria'],Paperback,,564,Three Rivers Press,May 24th 2005,1985,[],1451,"['397', '527', '398', '100', '29']",91.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1325634905l/159850.jpg,24,1,5.97

When temperatures drop below 56°F, tin crumbles into powder. Were the soldiers of the Grande Armée acutee fatally weakened by cold because the buttons of their uniforms fell apart? How different our world might be if tin did not disintegrate at low temperatures and the French had continued their eastward expansion!  This fascinating book tells the stories of seventeen molecules that, like the tin of those buttons, greatly influenced the course of history. These molecules provided the impetus for early exploration and made possible the ensuing voyages of discovery. They resulted in grand feats of engineering and spurred advances in medicine; lie behind changes in gender roles, in law, and in the environment; and have determined what we today eat, drink, and wear.  Showing how a change as small as the position of an atom can lead to enormous differences in the properties of a substance, the authors reveal the astonishing chemical connections among seemingly unrelated events.

71592.Atala_Ren_,Atala / René,,"François-René de Chateaubriand, Irving Putter (Translator)",3.29,"Chateaubriand was the giant of French literature in the early nineteenth century. Drawing on eighteenth-century English romanticists, on explorers in America, and on Goethe's Werther, he had a profound effect on French writers from Victor Hugo and Lamartine to George Sand and Flaubert. A quixotic and paradoxical personality, he combined impressive careers as a brilliant prose-poet, a spiritual guide, a high-ranking diplomat, and an enterprising lover.Atala and René are his two best-known works, reflecting not only his own joys, aspirations, and despair, but the emerging tastes of a new literary era. Atala is the passionate and tragic love story of a young Indian couple wandering in the wilderness, enthralled by the beauties of nature, drawn to a revivified Christianity by its esthetic charm and consoling beneficence, and finally succumbing to the cruelty of fate.

On another front, Marr finds himself increasingly drawn toward more shocking, depraved sexual entanglements with the homeless men of his neighborhood, until it begins to seem that Hassler's death might hold some key to his own life as a gay man in the age of AIDS. As John Marr learns more about the enigma that was Timothy Hassler, his own increasing sexual debasement leads him to a point where his and the philosopher's lives collide violently.…Surely Samuel R.

If so, you probably faced the issue of eye fatigue after a long time working at the laptop. Or you struggled with the slow startup, uncomfortable keyboard, or noisy cooling fan of your laptop. In addition, you probably do not work all the time at your desk but want to use your laptop on the go.  To overcome all those issues and meet other specific requirements of persons writing a lot, a thoughtful selection of a laptop or tablet is necessary. It turns out that choosing the right laptop for a writer becomes quite hard when considering different requirements at the same time. In this guide, I help you to cope with that issue. I provide numerous advises on how to choose the best laptop or tablet for writing.  All recommendations given in this book have been developed over many years of tests and trials. As a Ph.D., computer scientist, software developer, and a writer, I personally checked a number of laptops and tablets. Frankly, I am a passionate user of them.  In contrast to numerous advice available on the Web, in this guide, I accurately justify all my recommendations. Thanks to those justifications, you will be able to evaluate by yourself how the actual conditions in which you work affect technical properties that your laptop or tablet should possess. Thus, you will be able to choose the best laptop or tablet for you.  I also assess in this guide the impact of different technical properties on the price of laptops and tablets. Using that information, it will be easier for you to decide to which particular property you are sticking to, and which you are ready to give up, due to the increased price of the device.  You may have your own idea about a laptop or tablet most suitable for writing. In spite of that, I strongly recommend you to confront your expectations with mine. In this guide, I indicate numerous specific requirements you might have not considered yet. In addition, it is always worth it to verify or supplement your preferences before making a final decision to buy an often expensive device.  Let me underline that in this guide, I do not use any brand names, names of laptops, tablets or companies producing them. Instead, I provide specific technical properties which the laptop or tablet suitable for writing should possess.  The chapters of this guide are ordered in accordance with the priorities, which in my opinion should be given to individual properties of the laptop or tablet suitable for writers. In this way, while reading the following chapters, you will be able to gradually precise your requirements regarding screen type and size, type of the processor, disk, keyboard and other.  The conclusion coming from all given advices are two recommended specifications: one for the laptop and second for the tablet. Both specifications which I present in the last chapter of this guide should meet the writers’ expectations.

Worse: the owner of the land he needs to buy doesn’t want him there. In fact, Becca O’Neill loathes him so much that she won’t even serve him the award-winning scones her famed Wild Irish Rose Bed and Breakfast is known for.  Even worse than that (and not getting scones is bad in Trevor’s book): Becca has an ornery cat, a mischievous Irish setter, and a famous ghost all intent on making sure he fails.

46043078-the-works-of-his-hands,The Works of His Hands: A Scientist's Journey from Atheism to Faith,,Sy Garte,4.51,"Raised in a militant atheist family, Sy Garte fell in love with the factual world of science. He became a respected research biochemist with an anti-theistic worldview to bolster his work--and he had no intention of seeking a God he didn't believe in. That is, until the very science he loved led him to question the validity of an atheistic worldview. His journey to answer the questions that confronted him drew him into becoming a fully committed Christian, determined to show others the truth: modern science doesn't contradict God at all but instead supports Christianity.In the first half of the book, Sy begins with how his experiences and quest for knowledge as a student and early in his career brought him to question his materialist assumptions. He goes on to reveal how lessons from physics, biology, and human nature--all presented for lay readers to easily understand--actually argue for belief in God. In the second half of the book, Sy looks at the arguments often presented against God in academic and scientific settings and explains the false foundations on which they rest.For those who have been told that the realities of science call for a rejection of God--but can't quite get rid of the feeling that this shouldn't be true--The Works of His Hands is an ideal reminder that the two don't have to be bitter enemies. Instead, this transformative book shares the beauty of the marriage between science and faith--and how, together, they can bring even the most unlikely to salvation.",en,9780825446078,"['Christian', 'Science', 'Memoir']",[],Paperback,,256,Kregel Publications,November 19th 2019,,[],39,"['24', '13', '1', '0', '1']",97.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563333497l/46043078.jpg,24,1,14.53

Following on the bestselling success of Cold Hit, Likely to Die, and Final Jeopardy, top Manhattan sex crimes DA Linda Fairstein brings her unique blend of authenticity and style to a mesmerizing tale of murder and deceit.  It's the holiday season but there's little reason for cheer at one of New York's most elite colleges. A respected professor is dead; strangled and dumped in an elevator shaft. Lola Dakota's lifeless fingers clutch a few strands of hair, and a piece of paper in her pocket reads ""The Deadhouse.""  What brought a distinguished academic to such a tragic end? Opportunistic murder seems unlikely as assistant DA Alexandra Cooper, working with detectives Mike Chapman and Mercer Wallace, uncovers a distressing pattern of betrayal and terror.  There's proof that Lola's husband, Ivan, wanted her dead. He has an alibi, but could he have hired a killer? Or could one of Lola's colleagues have erupted into unexpected violence? Some of their stories don't quite ring true. And why did Lola have a photograph of twenty-year-old Charlotte Voight pinned to her office bulletin board? Charlotte left her dorm room eight months ago and vanished into the night. Is she dead? Could she and Lola have become victims of the same predator?  Perhaps most puzzling of all are the words ""The Deadhouse."" What was Lola's connection to this desolate place where people once endured slow and agonizing deaths?

970761.Poor_Fool,Poor Fool,,Erskine Caldwell,3.74,"Published in 1930, Poor Fool was Erskine Caldwell's second novel. Like most of his fiction, it revolves around a gallery of grotesque characters motivated by the basest urges. The novel's central figure is Blondy Niles, a down-and-out boxer who exists at the very fringes of society. The garish nighttime world of bars and prostitutes, con men and petty crimes is the milieu in which he moves. When he is approached by Salty Banks to be an unwitting fall guy in a rigged boxing scheme, a calamitous chain of events is set in motion, and death is the inevitable result. Blondy is befriended by a good-hearted prostitute, Louise, but then comes under the powerful, mysterious spell of the gruesome Mrs. Boxx, an enormous, soulless woman who lures him to her house, which has been converted into the most primitive of abortion mills. Despite the terrible acts Mrs. Boxx oversees and that Blondy is compelled to participate in, he inexplicably finds himself unable - or unwilling - to leave this chamber of horror. Only with the help of Dorothy, Mrs. Boxx's younger, daughter, does he finally free himself from the clutches of this demonic, madwoman. Yet freedom proves elusive, for by the end of this surreal, phantasmagoric adventure, Blondy and everyone he cares for have come to a bloody end. Caldwell himself likened Poor Fool to a ""diabolical dream."" Written early in his career, it foreshadows many of the themes that were to characterize his later novels.",English,9780807119471,['Fiction'],[],Paperback,,131,Louisiana State University Press,October 1st 1994,1930,[],46,"['14', '15', '10', '5', '2']",85.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349025010l/970761.jpg,23,1,6.94

Times Educational Supplement In this hugely ambitious and wide-ranging history of Britain, Eric Evans surveys a period in which Britain was transformed into the world's first industrial, while the foundations of the largest empire the world had seen were also being securely laid. This was an era of unprecedented political crisis, economic opportunity and social upheaval unparalleled in Britain, yet one during which transformation was achieved without revolution. The unique and potent combination of transition and transformation is a major theme in this book.   The book ranges ranges across key political, diplomatic, social, cultural, economic and religious themes in a series of short, lively chapters whose purpose is to convey the overall drama of hectic change which stopped well short of political revolution.  Britain was still ruled by wealthy landonwners in 1870 as it had been in 1783.  The world over which they presided, however, had been transformed utterly.  It had become an urban, industrial and commercial society, a change achieved without revolution.  [Evans examines whether their success in doing so was due more to good management than good fortune.] This new edition includes a new and revisionist introductory chapter and a thoroughly updated bibliography.  The book appears with illustrations for the first time. Eric J. Evans is Professor of History at Lancaster University and the author of a number of seminal books on the political and social history of eighteenth and nineteenth century Britain.",English,9780582089532,['History'],[],Paperback,,504,Addison Wesley Publishing Company,April 1st 1996,October 3rd 1983,[],35,"['7', '14', '11', '2', '1']",91.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1190667892l/1943670.jpg,23,1,5.94

Decades later, she realized that in her efforts to achieve normality she had not spoken to her children or her grandchildren of her terrifying odyssey. Her memoir of the period between 1939 and 1945, was written for her children so that they would Inherit the Truth.This is the story of the destruction of a talented Jewish family, and of the survival against all the odds of two young sisters. Anita and her elder sister Renate defied death at the hands of the Gestapo and the SS over a period of two and a half years, being first imprisoned as criminals and then being transferred, separately to Auschwitz, and finally to Belsen. They were saved by their exceptional courage, determination and ingenuity, and by several improbable strokes of good luck -- the greatest of which was the fact that Anita played the cello. Lasker-Wallfisch draws from her own startlingly vivid memories of her experience, and also incorporates the letters her family wrote to one another during this period as well as other primary documents. She succeeds in conveying -- in unsentimental prose -- what it was to have been a Jew living in Germany at the time of the Third Reich and what it was to have survived.",English,9780312208974,"['Holocaust', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography']",[],Hardcover,,176,Thomas Dunne Books,April 22nd 2000,January 1st 1996,[],199,"['91', '63', '42', '3', '0']",98.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312050061l/1283986.jpg,23,1,40.58

Using the innovative concept of slow violence to describe these threats, Rob Nixon focuses on the inattention we have paid to the attritional lethality of many environmental crises, in contrast with the sensational, spectacle-driven messaging that impels public activism today. Slow violence, because it is so readily ignored by a hard-charging capitalism, exacerbates the vulnerability of ecosystems and of people who are poor, disempowered, and often involuntarily displaced, while fueling social conflicts that arise from desperation as life-sustaining conditions erode.In a book of extraordinary scope, Nixon examines a cluster of writer-activists affiliated with the environmentalism of the poor in the global South. By approaching environmental justice literature from this transnational perspective, he exposes the limitations of the national and local frames that dominate environmental writing. And by skillfully illuminating the strategies these writer-activists deploy to give dramatic visibility to environmental emergencies, Nixon invites his readers to engage with some of the most pressing challenges of our time.",English,9780674049307,"['Environment', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Ecology', 'Academic', 'Climate Change', 'Theory', 'Criticism', 'Philosophy', 'Literary Criticism']",[],Hardcover,,353,Harvard University Press,July 14th 2011,July 1st 2011,['American Book Award (2012)'],371,"['197', '125', '43', '5', '1']",98.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348999771l/10429440.jpg,23,1,21.68

He explores the “accidental” drop of a Nagasaki-type bomb on a train conductor’s home, the implanting of plutonium into patients’ hearts, and the invention of wild tactical nukes, including weapons designed to kill enemy astronauts.Told in a riveting narrative voice, Herzog—the son of filmmaker Werner Herzog—also draws on childhood memories of the final period of the Cold War in Germany, the country once seen as the nuclear battleground for NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries, and discusses evidence that Nazi scientists knew how to make atomic weaponry . . . and chose not to.",English,9781612191737,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Politics', 'Military Fiction', 'Historical', 'Technology']",[],Hardcover,,256,Melville House,April 28th 2013,2012,[],166,"['34', '77', '41', '11', '3']",92.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362466560l/15799221.jpg,23,1,10.37

Now he has been unmasked as a Russian agent and subjected to a disgrace that is almost a kind of death.

In a move that many consider the salvation of the Texas A&M football program, Coach Bryant put 115 players through the most grueling practices ever imagined.

Meredith Norton chronicles every step of her experience, starting with her bizarre symptoms while living in Paris to moving back home to California and living with her compulsive parents and their five television sets. Irreverent and incredibly funny, Norton rails against self-pity and victimhood and rants about the innumerable copies of Lance Armstrong’s cancer survival book pressed on her by well-meaning family and friends. Alongside the harrowing portrait of her treatments, Norton offers equally amusing memories from her offbeat life. We see her childhood time during a somewhat racist ski trip, a family reunion at a Florida alligator farm, and her life in a tree house with a neighbor, who, despite being vegan, hates mice enough to taxidermy them into miniature versions of racecar drivers, Jesus, a UPS delivery man, and Sally Jesse Raphael.

But amid the collegiate turmoil, Alamo House is also the scene of an extraordinary, endearing friendship among three women: Mary Jo, hilariously confused about life and love but determined to get both right; Fayrene, flushed with freedom after her escape from Baptist Waco; and Collie, party girl and self-proclaimed guide to the ways of the world. Together they embark on a roller coaster of escapades that changes them all—and galvanizes Alamo House into an all-out counterattack against the SUKs.

16280863-intellectuals-and-race,Intellectuals and Race,,Thomas Sowell,4.38,"Thomas Sowell's incisive critique of the intellectuals' destructive role in shaping ideas about race in America Intellectuals and Race is a radical book in the original sense of one that goes to the root of the problem. The role of intellectuals in racial strife is explored in an international context that puts the American experience in a wholly new light.  The views of individual intellectuals have spanned the spectrum, but the views of intellectuals as a whole have tended to cluster. Indeed, these views have clustered at one end of the spectrum in the early twentieth century and then clustered at the opposite end of the spectrum in the late twentieth century. Moreover, these radically different views of race in these two eras were held by intellectuals whose views on other issues were very similar in both eras. Intellectuals and Race is not, however, a book about history, even though it has much historical evidence, as well as demographic, geographic, economic and statistical evidence -- all of it directed toward testing the underlying assumptions about race that have prevailed at times among intellectuals in general, and especially intellectuals at the highest levels. Nor is this simply a theoretical exercise. The impact of intellectuals' ideas and crusades on the larger society, both past and present, is the ultimate concern. These ideas and crusades have ranged widely from racial theories of intelligence to eugenics to ""social justice"" and multiculturalism.  In addition to in-depth examinations of these and other issues, Intellectuals and Race explores the incentives, the visions and the rationales that drive intellectuals at the highest levels to conclusions that have often turned out to be counterproductive and even disastrous, not only for particular racial or ethnic groups, but for societies as a whole.",English,9780465058723,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'History', 'Race', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Cultural', 'Society']",[],Hardcover,,192,Basic Books,March 12th 2013,,[],803,"['456', '243', '70', '24', '10']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357613803l/16280863.jpg,22,1,21.14

But when a new admission to the critical care unit almost died his first night on call, he found himself scrambling. Visions of mastery quickly gave way to hopes of simply surviving hospital life, where confidence was hard to come by and no amount of med school training could dispel the terror of facing actual patients.This funny, candid memoir of McCarthy’s intern year at a New York hospital provides a scorchingly frank look at how doctors are made, taking readers into patients’ rooms and doctors’ conferences to witness a physician's journey from ineptitude to competence. McCarthy's one stroke of luck paired him with a brilliant second-year adviser he called “Baio” (owing to his resemblance to the Charles in Charge star), who proved to be a remarkable teacher with a wicked sense of humor. McCarthy would learn even more from the people he cared for, including a man named Benny, who was living in the hospital for months at a time awaiting a heart transplant. But no teacher could help McCarthy when an accident put his own health at risk, and showed him all too painfully the thin line between doctor and patient.The Real Doctor Will See You Shortly offers a window on to hospital life that dispenses with sanctimony and self-seriousness while emphasizing the black-comic paradox of becoming a doctor: How do you learn to save lives in a job where there is no practice?",English,9780804138659,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Biography', 'Health', 'Science', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Audiobook']",[],Hardcover,,336,Crown,April 7th 2015,,[],5204,"['1743', '2336', '944', '144', '37']",97.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1418768118l/22716448.jpg,22,1,5.20

At the edges of the world stand walls of ice which push slowly forward to reclaim the land for the night. And at the world's center, in the Holy Land where two great religions were born, are the Wells of Ihrain, the source of the greatest magics. Over the last century the Patriarchs of the West have demanded crusades to claim the Wells from the Pramans, the followers of the Written. Now an uneasy truce extends between the Pramans and the West, waiting for a spark to start the conflict anew. Then, on a mission in the Holy Land, the young Praman warrior Else is attacked by a creature of the Dark-in effect, a minor god. Too ignorant to know that he can never prevail over such a thing, he fights it and wins, and in so doing, sets the terrors of the night against him. As a reward for his success, Else is sent as a spy to the heart of the Patriarchy to direct their attention away from further ventures into the Holy Lands. Dogged by hidden enemies and faithless allies, Else witnesses senseless butchery and surprising acts of faith as he penetrates to the very heart of the Patriarchy and rides alongside their armies in a new crusade against his own people. But the Night rides with him, too, sending two of its once-human agents from the far north to assassinate him. Submerged in his role, he begins to doubt his faith, his country, even his family. As his mission careens out of control, he faces unanswerable questions about his future. It is said that God will know his own, but can one who has slain gods ever know forgiveness? In The Tyranny of the Night, Glen Cook introduces a new fantasy epic for the ages.",English,9780765345967,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Dark Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'War', 'Epic', 'High Fantasy', 'Military Fiction', 'Collections']",[],Mass Market Paperback,,505,Tor Fantasy,October 31st 2006,,[],2037,"['505', '752', '530', '158', '92']",88.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389333071l/325398.jpg,22,1,3.77

When it was kill or be killed, she didn’t hesitate. Now, she’s the only one left standing, haunted by the ghost of a dead man and plagued with the guilt of having taken another person’s life. The upheaval of her life to start over in Rock Falls has been rocky at best, her worst nightmares and wildest desires colliding with each other. Terror tortures her nightly, breeding fear inside her dreams, and in every waking moment, she fights against the lust that threatens to drown her. Jayden King harbors secrets beneath his outward playboy demeanor. The women who warm his bed lay claim to nothing—you can’t lay claim to someone who doesn’t have a heart. His wit and charm are exquisite means of deflection and distraction from the turmoil roaring inside him. He’s hidden in plain sight, a mask of humor keeping the sadness at bay. The only real reflections of his soul are in the artwork he creates, pieces of him muraled on the skin of others. If tattoo artists could have a calling card, the etch of pain and suffering in each design would be his. Because when the lights go out and the women he’s satisfied have gone home, he’s alone with every fear he refuses to face.After suffering from a brutal attack at the hands of her roommate’s stalker, Peyton is forced to live with the object of her affection. Without intention, she breathes love into his starved heart, and although the mere thought of that terrifies him, Jayden would burn the city down to keep her safe, causalities be damned. Some people you have. Some people you hold. She can have him. She can hold him. But can she keep King? Or is it impossible for Callaghan to keep something that was never really hers to begin with?Can be read as a standalone or as part of the Rock Falls series.",English,9999999999999,"['Romance', 'New Adult', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Contemporary']",[],Kindle Edition,,189,Amazon Digital Services,October 2015,March 2nd 2015,[],710,"['343', '275', '80', '8', '4']",98.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1444810558l/27193458._SY475_.jpg,22,1,
25013.A_Crack_in_the_Edge_of_the_World,A Crack in the Edge of the World,,Simon Winchester,3.79,"The international bestselling author of The Professor and the Madman and Krakatoa vividly brings to life the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake that leveled a city symbolic of America's relentless western expansion. Simon Winchester has also fashioned an enthralling and informative informative look at the tumultuous subterranean world that produces earthquakes, the planet's most sudden and destructive force.In the early morning hours of April 18, 1906, San Francisco and a string of towns to its north-northwest and the south-southeast were overcome by an enormous shaking that was compounded by the violent shocks of an earthquake, registering 8.25 on the Richter scale. The quake resulted from a rupture in a part of the San Andreas fault, which lies underneath the earth's surface along the northern coast of California. Lasting little more than a minute, the earthquake wrecked 490 blocks, toppled a total of 25,000 buildings, broke open gas mains, cut off electric power lines throughout the Bay area, and effectively destroyed the gold rush capital that had stood there for a half century.Perhaps more significant than the tremors and rumbling, which affected a swatch of California more than 200 miles long, were the fires that took over the city for three days, leaving chaos and horror in its wake. The human tragedy included the deaths of upwards of 700 people, with more than 250,000 left homeless. It was perhaps the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States.Simon Winchester brings his inimitable storytelling abilities -- as well as his unique understanding of geology -- to this extraordinary event, exploring not only what happened in northern California in 1906 but what we have learned since about the geological underpinnings that caused the earthquake in the first place. But his achievement is even greater: he positions the quake's significance along the earth's geological timeline and shows the effect it had on the rest of twentieth-century California and American history.A Crack in the Edge of the World is the definitive account of the San Francisco earthquake. It is also a fascinating exploration of a legendary event that changed the way we look at the planet on which we live.",English,9780060572006,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Geology', 'American History', 'Audiobook', 'Nature', 'Historical', 'Environment', 'Natural History']",[],Paperback,,419,Harper Perennial,October 10th 2006,October 4th 2005,[],6325,"['1591', '2516', '1624', '462', '132']",91.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407106491l/25013.jpg,22,1,6.55

Vyr Daye is the Red Dragon, alpha to the Sons of Beasts Crew, loner, watcher, fire-breather…and he’s also completely misunderstood. The media has dragged him through the mud, his reputation is shot, and his own father helped to put him in prison for a one-year sentence. Only this prison isn’t what it seems and he’s fighting to keep his dragon alive. All he needs to do is keep steady for six more months and then he can live his life as quietly as possible with his crew, but one sexy, fast-talking prison counselor saunters in and wrecks his focus. Riyah isn’t what she seems, but no one can sense her powers besides Vyr. He’ll keep her secrets if she keeps his. And as the dragon inside of him starts losing his battle, he’ll need her help to gather his crew and pull him from the brink before it’s too late. And the more he gets to know the beguiling woman, the more he thinks she’s here for more important reasons than even he understands.  Riyah Mercer has been hired to infiltrate the shifter prison and watch Vyr’s back. He doesn’t trust her, but he doesn’t realize she is his only friend here. She can see him struggling, and can see the dragon fading. As she starts falling hard for the stoic man, she becomes determined to do anything to save him. But saving the dragon means unleashing his fire on the world, and that’s not the only danger Riyah is in. There are eyes everywhere in the prison and they are creating something monstrous down in the cell where they keep the Red Dragon. If she is caught helping the man she’s falling in love with, it could mean the end for them both.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets.

There are a lot of perks to Teddycat life, but there’s also a lot of responsibility--and rules--that come with it.  Here are some things that Teddycats CANNOT do:   • Use their super-strong, razor-sharp claws for anything except climbing or life-or-death situations    • Reveal their existence or the location of Cloud Kingdom to humans and other predators   And the number one thing that Teddycats can definitely, no matter what, NEVER do:   • Bring outsiders into Cloud Kingdom    That last rule is the most serious one of all.

3345720-waltz-with-bashir,Waltz With Bashir: A Lebanon War Story,,"Ari Folman, David Polonsky",3.93,"""Special, strange, and peculiarly potent... Extraordinary."" —Variety One night in Beirut in September 1982, while Israeli soldiers secured the area, Christian militia members entered the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila and began to massacre hundreds, if not thousands, of Palestinians. Ari Folman was one of those Israeli soldiers, but for more than twenty years he remembered nothing of that night or of the weeks leading up to it. Then came a friend's disturbing dream, and with it Folman's need to excavate the truth of the war in Lebanon and answer the crucial question: what was he doing during the hours of slaughter? Challenging the collective amnesia of friends and fellow soldiers, Folman painfully, candidly pieces together the war and his place in it. Gradually, the blankness of his mind is filled in by scenes of combat and patrol, misery and carnage, as well as dreams and hallucinations. Soldiers are haunted by inexplicable nightmares and flashbacks - snapping, growling dogs with teeth bared and eyes glowing orange; a recurring image of three young men rising naked out of the sea to drift into the Beirut battlefield. Tanks crush cars and buildings with lethal indifference; snipers pick off men on donkeys, men in cars, men drinking coffee; a soldier waltzes through a storm of bullets; rock songs fill the air, and then yellow flares. The recollections accumulate until Ari Folman arrives at Sabra and Shatila and his investigation reaches its terrible end. The result is a gripping reconstruction, a probing inquiry into the unreliable quality of memory, and, above all, a powerful denunciation of the senselessness of all wars. Profoundly original in form and approach, Waltz with Bashir will take its place as one of the great works of wartime testimony.",English,9780805088922,"['Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Israel', 'Memoir', 'Lebanon', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Biography']",[],Paperback,,128,Metropolitan Books,February 17th 2009,2008,[],1960,"['569', '804', '489', '81', '17']",95.0,['Beirut (Lebanon)'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312051099l/3345720.jpg,21,1,16.96

10197857-treasure-islands,Treasure Islands: Uncovering the Damage of Offshore Banking and Tax Havens,,Nicholas Shaxson,4.2,"A thrilling ride inside the world of tax havens and corporate mastermindsWhile the United States experiences recession and economic stagnation and European countries face bankruptcy, experts struggle to make sense of the crisis. Nicholas Shaxson, a former correspondent for the Financial Times and The Economist, argues that tax havens are a central cause of all these disasters.In this hard hitting investigation he uncovers how offshore tax evasion, which has cost the U.S. 100 billion dollars in lost revenue each year, is just one item on a long rap sheet outlining the damage that offshoring wreaks on our societies. In a riveting journey from Moscow to London to Switzerland to Delaware, Shaxson dives deep into a vast and secret playground where bankers and multinational corporations operate side by side with nefarious tax evaders, organized criminals and the world's wealthiest citizens. Tax havens are where all these players get to maximize their own rewards and leave the middle class to pick up the bill.With eye opening revelations, Treasure Islands exposes the culprits and its victims, and shows how:*Over half of world trade is routed through tax havens*The rampant practices that precipitated the latest financial crisis can be traced back to Wall Street's offshoring practices*For every dollar of aid we send to developing countries, ten dollars leave again by the backdoorThe offshore system sits much closer to home than the pristine tropical islands of the popular imagination. In fact, it all starts on a tiny island called Manhattan. In this fast paced narrative, Treasure Islands at last explains how the system works and how it's contributing to our ever deepening economic divide.",English,9780230105010,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Business', 'History', 'Taxation', 'Crime', 'Society', 'World History']",[],Hardcover,,272,St. Martin's Press,April 12th 2011,January 6th 2011,['Bread and Roses Award Nominee for Shortlist (2012)'],1363,"['594', '517', '199', '37', '16']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312071994l/10197857.jpg,21,1,13.76

16248513-plutopia,"Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters",,Kate Brown,4.18,"While many transnational histories of the nuclear arms race have been written, Kate Brown provides the first definitive account of the great plutonium disasters of the United States and the Soviet Union.In Plutopia,  Brown draws on official records and dozens of interviews to tell the extraordinary stories of Richland, Washington and Ozersk, Russia-the first two cities in the world to produce plutonium. To contain secrets, American and Soviet leaders created plutopias--communities of nuclear families living in highly-subsidized, limited-access atomic cities. Fully employed and medically monitored, the residents of Richland and Ozersk enjoyed all the pleasures of consumer society, while nearby, migrants, prisoners, and soldiers were banned from plutopia--they lived in temporary ""staging grounds"" and often performed the most dangerous work at the plant. Brown shows that the plants' segregation of permanent and temporary workers and of nuclear and non-nuclear zones created a bubble of immunity, where dumps and accidents were glossed over and plant managers freely embezzled and polluted. In four decades, the Hanford plant near Richland and the Maiak plant near Ozersk each issued at least 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment--equaling four Chernobyls--laying waste to hundreds of square miles and contaminating rivers, fields, forests, and food supplies. Because of the decades of secrecy, downwind and downriver neighbors of the plutonium plants had difficulty proving what they suspected, that the rash of illnesses, cancers, and birth defects in their communities were caused by the plants' radioactive emissions. Plutopia was successful because in its zoned-off isolation it appeared to deliver the promises of the American dream and Soviet communism; in reality, it concealed disasters that remain highly unstable and threatening today.An untold and profoundly important piece of Cold War history, Plutopia invites readers to consider the nuclear footprint left by the arms race and the enormous price of paying for it.",English,9780199855766,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Russia', 'American History', 'Grad School', 'Reportage', 'Politics', 'Russian History', 'United States']",[],Hardcover,,406,"Oxford University Press, USA",April 5th 2013,2013,"['John H.

When Orhan’s brilliant and eccentric grandfather Kemal—a man who built a dynasty out of making kilim rugs—is found dead, submerged in a vat of dye, Orhan inherits the decades-old business. But Kemal’s will raises more questions than it answers. He has left the family estate to a stranger thousands of miles away, an aging woman in an Armenian retirement home in Los Angeles. Her existence and secrecy about her past only deepen the mystery of why Orhan’s grandfather willed his home in Turkey to an unknown woman rather than to his own son or grandson. Left with only Kemal’s ancient sketchbook and intent on righting this injustice, Orhan boards a plane to Los Angeles. There he will not only unearth the story that eighty-seven-year-old Seda so closely guards but discover that Seda’s past now threatens to unravel his future. Her story, if told, has the power to undo the legacy upon which his family has been built.  Moving back and forth in time, between the last years of the Ottoman Empire and the 1990s, Orhan’s Inheritance is a story of passionate love, unspeakable horrors, incredible resilience, and the hidden stories that can haunt a family for generations. “Aline Ohanesian draws from her family’s own dark history to create a tender, powerful story of love and reclamation.

Shunning their traditions means his silverback is out of control and on a one-way track to crazy-town. He accepted his shortened life a long time ago, but right now all he wants to do is live long enough to for a couple last bucket list items. When a rare beauty shows up at his door and offers to keep his animal steady for two hundred bucks a week, well, he’s mighty tempted to pay to prolong his life.

Sixty-six million years ago, the Earth’s most fearsome creatures vanished. Today they remain one of our planet’s great mysteries. Now The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs reveals their extraordinary, 200-million-year-long story as never before.In this captivating narrative (enlivened with more than seventy original illustrations and photographs), Steve Brusatte, a young American paleontologist who has emerged as one of the foremost stars of the field—naming fifteen new species and leading groundbreaking scientific studies and fieldwork—masterfully tells the complete, surprising, and new history of the dinosaurs, drawing on cutting-edge science to dramatically bring to life their lost world and illuminate their enigmatic origins, spectacular flourishing, astonishing diversity, cataclysmic extinction, and startling living legacy. Captivating and revelatory, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a book for the ages.Brusatte traces the evolution of dinosaurs from their inauspicious start as small shadow dwellers—themselves the beneficiaries of a mass extinction caused by volcanic eruptions at the beginning of the Triassic period—into the dominant array of species every wide-eyed child memorizes today, T. rex, Triceratops, Brontosaurus, and more. This gifted scientist and writer re-creates the dinosaurs’ peak during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, when thousands of species thrived, and winged and feathered dinosaurs, the prehistoric ancestors of modern birds, emerged. The story continues to the end of the Cretaceous period, when a giant asteroid or comet struck the planet and nearly every dinosaur species (but not all) died out, in the most extraordinary extinction event in earth’s history, one full of lessons for today as we confront a “sixth extinction.”Brusatte also recalls compelling stories from his globe-trotting expeditions during one of the most exciting eras in dinosaur research—which he calls “a new golden age of discovery”—and offers thrilling accounts of some of the remarkable findings he and his colleagues have made, including primitive human-sized tyrannosaurs; monstrous carnivores even larger than T. rex; and paradigm-shifting feathered raptors from China.An electrifying scientific history that unearths the dinosaurs’ epic saga, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs will be a definitive and treasured account for decades to come.",en,9780062490452,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Dinosaurs', 'Animals', 'Nature', 'Audiobook', 'Palaeontology', 'Biology', 'Natural History']",[],ebook,,416,William Morrow,April 24th 2018,,['Goodreads Choice Award for Science & Technology (2018)'],17470,"['6993', '7101', '2549', '566', '261']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1516138953l/35068612._SY475_.jpg,21,1,

1074682.Chowringhee,Chowringhee,,"Sankar, Arunava Sinha (Goodreads Author) (Translator)",3.96,"‘Here, day and night were interchangeable. The immaculately dressed Chowringhee, radiant in her youth, had just stepped on to the floor at the nightclub.’ Set in 1950s Calcutta, Chowringhee is a sprawling saga of the intimate lives of managers, employees and guests at one of Calcutta’s largest hotels, the Shahjahan. Shankar, the newest recruit, recounts the stories of several people whose lives come together in the suites, restaurants, bar and backrooms of the hotel. As both observer and participant in the events, he inadvertently peels off the layers of everyday existence to expose the seamy underbelly of unfulfilled desires, broken dreams, callous manipulation and unbidden tragedy. What unfolds is not just the story of individual lives but also the incredible chronicle of a metropolis. Written by best-selling Bengali author Sankar, Chowringhee was published as a novel in 1962. Predating Arthur Hailey’s Hotel by three years, it became an instant hit, spawning translations in major Indian languages, a film and a play. Its larger-than-life characters—the enigmatic manager Marco Polo, the debonair receptionist Sata Bose, the tragic hostess Karabi Guha, among others—soon attained cult status. With its thinly veiled accounts of the private lives of real-life celebrities, and its sympathetic narrative seamlessly weaving the past and the present, it immediately established itself as a popular classic. Available for the first time in English, Chowringhee is as much a dirge as it is a homage to a city and its people.An excerpt (Chapter 1) from the book :http://arunavasinha.in/2011/05/27/cho...",English,9780143101031,"['Fiction', 'India', 'Indian Literature', 'Drama', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Asian Literature', 'Literature', 'Tragedy']",[],Paperback,,403,Penguin Global,January 2nd 2007,June 1962,"['Independent Foreign Fiction Prize Nominee for Shortlist (2010)', 'Crossword Book Award for Translation (2007)']",1836,"['609', '706', '399', '90', '32']",93.0,"['India', 'Kolkata (India)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347463196l/1074682.jpg,21,1,3.12

I make no apologies for these. The only explanation I can make is that in the years which elapsed between the events in this book, and the later novel dealing with the final destruction of the Sharra matrix, Lew's memories of these events may have altered his perceptions. Or, as I myself believe, the telepaths of the Arilinn Tower may have mercifully blurred his memories, to save his reason.

It's going to be a tough trial. Manhattan sex-crimes prosecutor Alexandra Cooper's case, involving an attack on investment banker Paige Vallis, would be difficult to prove even without the latest development -- it seems that Paige has something to hide.  Most of her story is clear. She'd had dinner with New York consultant Andrew Tripping three times before the March evening when she accepted his invitation to accompany him to his apartment. But what occurred that night? Why didn't she leave the apartment when he started to act strangely? What about Tripping's little boy, Dulles? What happened to the child that fateful evening? And who is the strange man whose appearance in the courtroom seems to terrify Paige?  While Alex's police detective friend Mercer Wallace helps her learn more of the sad details behind the increasingly puzzling rape case, colleague Mike Chapman is uptown in a decaying Harlem brownstone where eighty-two-year-old McQueen Ransome has been murdered, her apartment ransacked.  What could this impoverished, elderly woman have possessed that could have inspired such violence? Photographs on the wall suggest that ""Queenie"" was once a beautiful and voluptuous young woman who traveled to faraway places. Could there be a clue to her murder in her exotic background?  Her murder will be only the first. Others follow, as the tragic strands of the Paige Vallis and McQueen Ransome cases begin to converge in a poignant alliance of two women from very different worlds.  Faced with formidable personal and professional choices, Alex must learn the old lesson that appearances can deceive, even as she heads for a showdown in which her wits and her courage will be tested as never before.

That Adamo will not allow. Though he is not without friends—Royston, a powerful magician, and Balfour, a former corpsman—there is only so much Adamo and his allies can do. Adamo has been put out to pasture, given a professorship at the University. Royston, already exiled once, dares not risk the Esar’s wrath a second time. And Balfour, who lost both hands in the climactic battle of the war, is now a diplomat who spends most of his time trying to master his new hands—metal replacements that operate on the same magical principles as the dragons and have earned him an assortment of nicknames of which “Steelhands” is the least offensive.But sometimes help comes where you least expect it. In this case, from two first-year university students freshly arrived in Thremedon from the country: Laurence, a feisty young woman whose father raised her to be the son he never had, and Toverre, her fiancé, a brilliant if neurotic dandy who would sooner share his wife-to-be’s clothes than her bed.

But the next morning, it was all still true: Chris was dead.  His girlfriend Adriane, Nora's best friend, was catatonic. And Max, Nora's sweet, smart, soft-spoken Prince Charming, was gone. He was also—according to the police, according to her parents, according to everyone—a murderer.Desperate to prove his innocence, Nora follows the trail of blood, no matter where it leads. It ultimately brings her to the ancient streets of Prague, where she is drawn into a dark web of secret societies and shadowy conspirators, all driven by a mad desire to possess something that might not even exist. For buried in a centuries-old manuscript is the secret to ultimate knowledge and communion with the divine; it is said that he who controls the Lumen Dei controls the world.

But unlike her sister, Tali, and the other Takers who become Healers' League apprentices, Nya's skill is flawed: She can't push that pain into pynvium, the enchanted metal used to store it. All she can do is shift it into another person, a dangerous skill that she must keep hidden from forces occupying her city. If discovered, she'd be used as a human weapon against her own people. Rumors of another war make Nya's life harder, forcing her to take desperate risks just to find work and food. She pushes her luck too far and exposes her secret to a pain merchant eager to use her shifting ability for his own sinister purposes.

212087.The_Plutonium_Files,The Plutonium Files: America's Secret Medical Experiments in the Cold War,,Eileen Welsome,4.23,"When the vast wartime factories of the Manhattan Project began producing plutonium in quantities never before seen on earth, scientists working on the  top-secret bomb-building program grew apprehensive. Fearful that plutonium  might cause a cancer epidemic among workers and desperate to learn more about what it could do to the human body, the Manhattan Project's medical doctors embarked upon an experiment in which eighteen unsuspecting patients in  hospital wards throughout the country were secretly injected with the cancer-causing substance. Most of these patients would go to their graves without ever knowing what had been done to them.Now, in The Plutonium Files, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Eileen Welsome reveals for the first time the breadth of the extraordinary fifty-year cover-up surrounding the plutonium injections, as well as the deceitful nature of thousands of other experiments conducted on American citizens in the postwar years. Welsome's remarkable investigation spans the 1930s to the 1990s and draws upon hundreds of newly declassified documents and other primary sources to disclose this shadowy chapter in American history. She gives a voice to such innocents as Helen Hutchison, a young woman who entered a prenatal clinic in Nashville for a routine checkup and was instead given a radioactive ""cocktail"" to drink; Gordon Shattuck, one of several boys at a state school for the developmentally disabled in Massachusetts who was fed radioactive oatmeal for breakfast; and Maude Jacobs, a Cincinnati woman suffering from cancer and subjected to an experimental radiation treatment designed to help military planners learn how to win a nuclear war. Welsome also tells the stories of the scientists themselves, many of whom learned the ways of secrecy on the Manhattan Project. Among them are Stafford Warren, a grand figure whose bravado masked a cunning intelligence; Joseph Hamilton, who felt he was immune to the dangers of radiation only to suffer later from a fatal leukemia; and physician Louis Hempelmann, one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the plan to inject humans with potentially carcinogenic doses of plutonium. Hidden discussions of fifty years past are reconstructed here, wherein trusted government officials debated the ethical and legal implications of the experiments, demolishing forever the argument that these studies took place in a less enlightened era. Powered by her groundbreaking reportage and singular narrative gifts, Eileen Welsome has created a work of profound humanity as well as major historical significance.From the Hardcover edition.",English,9780385319546,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Politics', 'American History', 'War', 'Research', 'Biology']",[],Paperback,,592,Delta,October 20th 2010,1999,['PEN/Martha Albrand Award for First Nonfiction Writers (2000)'],430,"['200', '145', '70', '12', '3']",97.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1601566939l/212087.jpg,20,1,42.96

33544897-purpose-and-desire,"Purpose and Desire: What Makes Something ""Alive"" and Why Modern Darwinism Has Failed to Explain It",,J. Scott Turner,3.61,"A professor, biologist, and physiologist argues that modern Darwinism’s materialist and mechanistic biases have led to a scientific dead end, unable to define what life is—and only an openness to the qualities of ""purpose and desire"" will move the field forward.Scott Turner contends. ""To be scientists, we force ourselves into a Hobson’s choice on the matter: accept intentionality and purposefulness as real attributes of life, which disqualifies you as a scientist; or become a scientist and dismiss life’s distinctive quality from your thinking. I have come to believe that this choice actually stands in the way of our having a fully coherent theory of life.""Growing research shows that life's most distinctive quality, shared by all living things, is purpose and desire: maintain homeostasis to sustain life. In Purpose and Desire, Turner draws on the work of Claude Bernard, a contemporary of Darwin revered among physiologists as the founder of experimental medicine, to build on Bernard’s ""dangerous idea"" of vitalism, which seeks to identify what makes ""life"" a unique phenomenon of nature. To further its quest to achieve a fuller understanding of life, Turner argues, science must move beyond strictly accepted measures that consider only the mechanics of nature.A thoughtful appeal to widen our perspective of biology that is grounded in scientific evidence, Purpose and Desire helps us bridge the ideological evolutionary divide.",en,9780062651587,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Evolution', 'Philosophy']",[],ebook,,352,HarperOne,September 12th 2017,2017,[],59,"['15', '18', '17', '6', '3']",85.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492898536l/33544897.jpg,20,1,
2155.Jane_Austen_s_Letters,Jane Austen's Letters,,"Jane Austen, Deirdre Le Faye (Editor)",4.16,"Jane Austen's letters afford a unique insight into the daily life of the novelist: intimate and gossipy, observant and informative--they read much like the novels themselves. They bring alive her family and friends, her surroundings and contemporary events with a freshness unparalleled in modern biographies. Above all we recognize the unmistakable voice of the author of such novels as Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. We see the shift in her writing from witty and amusing descriptions of the social life of town and country, to a thoughtful and constructive tone while writing about the business of literary composition. R.W. Chapman's ground-breaking edition of the collected Letters first appeared in 1932, and a second edition followed twenty years later. Now in this third edition of Jane Austen's Letters, Deirdre Le Faye has added new material that has come to light since 1952, and re-ordered the letters into their correct chronological sequence. She has provided discreet and full annotation to each letter, including its provenance, and information on the watermarks, postmarks, and other physical details of the manuscripts, together with new biographical, topographical, and general indexes.

His assignment: a series of articles on the Allied occupation. His personal agenda: to find Lena, the German mistress he left behind at the outbreak of the war.  When Jake stumbles on a murder -- an American soldier washes up on the conference grounds -- he thinks he has found the key that will unlock his Berlin story. What Jake finds instead is a larger story of corruption and intrigue reaching deep into the heart of the occupation. Berlin in July 1945 is like nowhere else -- a tragedy, and a feverish party after the end of the world.  As Jake searches the ruins for Lena, he discovers that years of war have led to unimaginable displacement and degradation. As he hunts for the soldier's killer, he learns that Berlin has become a city of secrets, a lunar landscape that seethes with social and political tension. When the two searches become entangled, Jake comes to understand that the American Military Government is already fighting a new enemy in the east, busily identifying the ""good Germans"" who can help win the next war. And hanging over everything is the larger crime, a crime so huge that it seems -- the worst irony -- beyond punishment.

She was still as beautiful -- tall, slender, the glorious auburn hair, the soft, vulnerable mouth and peachbloom skin -- as when he had first met her at Montclair. At sixteen, Blythe had been shy, eager to be accepted and loved, now she was poised, fashionably dressed, self-confident. But in those same velvety brown eyes Rod saw what he was searching for -- that she still loved him. Would it be possible to bridge all the silent years that had separated them? Or had they changed too much? Had too much happened to make them different from the people they had been when they had fallen in love? Was it too late?

The Bone Vault begins in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's glorious Temple of Dendur, where wealthy donors have gathered to celebrate a controversial new exhibit. An uneasy mix of scholarship, showbiz, and aggressive marketing, ""A Modern Bestiary"" will be a joint venture of the Met and the American Museum of Natural History. With its IMAX time trips and Rembrandt refrigerator magnets, the ""Bestiary"" has raised fierce opposition from some of New York's museum elite. Assistant DA Alexandra Cooper, off duty for the evening, observes the developing tensions with bemused interest until Met director Pierre Thibodaux pulls her aside. He needs her advice. There's an urgent problem out at a loading dock on a New Jersey pier. A Twelfth Dynasty mummified princess, enclosed for eternity in a huge stone sarcophagus, is about to take a long voyage to Cairo as part of a routine museum exchange. But Cleopatra is missing, and in her place is the not-so-mummified body of a woman many centuries younger than her royal predecessor. Who is this woman with the small physique, the dark hair, and the shiny barrette? What is her connection, if any, to the rarefied world of priceless art and objects? And how and when did she become entombed in the sarcophagus? Teaming with cops Mike Chapman and Mercer Wallace, Alex must explore behind the scenes at the elegant but severe Metropolitan, travel uptown to the remote setting of the Cloisters and its medieval trove of funerary art, and on to the massive array of beasts and bones at the Museum of Natural History.

In this age of CNN-mediated war, the lives of those wretched populations of the earth—the refugees; the victims of unjust imprisonment and torture; the immigrants virtually enslaved by their starvation and legal disenfranchisement—are always presented to us as already irretrievable and thereby already lost. We may shake our heads at their wretchedness but then we sacrifice them nonetheless, for they are already forgone.By analyzing the different frames through which we experience war, Butler calls for a reorientation of the Left toward the precarity of those lives. Only by recognizing those lives as precarious lives—lives that are not yet lost but are ever fragile and in need of protection—might the Left stand in unity against the violence perpetrated through arbitrary state power.",English,9781844673339,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Politics', 'War', 'Feminism', 'Sociology', 'Academic', 'Gender', 'Photography']",[],Hardcover,,193,Verso,May 19th 2009,2009,[],659,"['280', '241', '112', '23', '3']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1373996383l/6420922.jpg,19,1,16.62

Homesteading Space, by two of Skylab’s own astronauts and a NASA journalist, tells the dramatic story of America’s first space station from beginning to fiery end.  Homesteading Space is much more than a story of technological and scientific success; it is also an absorbing, sometimes humorous, often inspiring account of the determined, hardworking individuals who shepherded the program through a near-disastrous launch, a heroic rescue, and an exhausting study of Comet Kohoutek, as well as the lab's ultimate descent into the Indian Ocean.

Trying to find her legs over the loss of her Clan, she has bought a local bar and just needs to keep her focus until it can pay the bills. That would probably be easier to do if she didn’t have a rogue werewolf sniffing around and showing up in unexpected places. She knows she’s being hunted, and her first look at Kade’s inner wolf should have her running for the hills, but for some reason, the more she learns about him, the more interesting he becomes. She’d been resigned to tackle life alone, but he’s dependable in unexpected ways. And when she starts learning how thoughtful and protective and caring the bad boy outlaw werewolf really is, she starts thinking he just might be a good match for a shifter like her. That is, until she realizes she’s not the only one being hunted.  Kade is good and done with people. Newly pledged to the Blackwood Crow Clan, he’s used to doing things on his own. Independence can get a rogue shifter into big trouble quick though, and he’s fighting fires his new Clan doesn’t know about. His life revolves around three things. Keeping his step brothers safe, Changing into a monstrous wolf for days at a time…and Trina. One look at her and he’s done for, but she deserves much better than a man who can’t even keep her safe from himself.

335940.Before_the_Dawn,Before the Dawn,,"Tōson Shimazaki, William E. Naff (Translator)",4.07,"Although Before the Dawn is the story of the author's family and of the Meiji restoration, it is much more than that; the aftermath of the events that form its context have fundamentally altered the nature of the world we live in. Its author was a man of sophistication and erudition even though he was not given to virtuoso displays of either quality. He created this novel out of his personal and artistic needs, and out of his sense of the need of Japan and the world community to know the story he tells in it. Japan has been richly served by the original. But Toson had a worldwide as well as a Japanese audience in mind when he wrote Before the Dawn. This translation has been done in the hope of contributing to that undertaking.Before the Dawn looks back on the adventure, turmoil, and tragedy of the mid-nineteenth century with a clear and unsentimental vision, but it speaks of those times in tones of tact, humility, and deference. It is a celebration of the humanity of its characters and the richness, complexity, and diversity of the lives they lived during the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate and the first two decades of the Meiji era. For all the weight of its historical concerns, it maintains its lyrical tone even when the subject is external threat, internal political turmoil, the grinding hardship of maintaining the old post system, or the bitter disappointments that the new age brought so many of those who had worked hardest and sacrificed most to bring it into being. It has been followed not only by scholarly studies but also by an immense outpouring of historical fiction, family and local histories, and other publications drawing on the rich store of old diaries and official records preserved throughout the country. These later works often illuminate the period from points of view that were not accessible to any of Toson's characters, but Before the Dawn remains the standard against which all others are measured. --from the Introduction",en,9780824811648,"['Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction']",[],Paperback,,816,University of Hawaii Press,July 1st 1988,April 1929,[],43,"['16', '15', '11', '1', '0']",98.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347592600l/335940.jpg,18,1,4.55

They say, ""Hey, Mr. Ghost, are you our dear departed king?"" But the ghost don’t say one motherfuckin’ thing. He goes, ""Wooo-wooo-wooo."" They say, ""Hey, we better split, And go tell Hamlet about this shit.""So they run find Hamlet, they say, ""Hey, sweet Prince, Your daddy’s ghost been seen runnin’ hither and hince. He’s all full of maggots and he’s grizzly and grim, Somethin’s rotten in Denmark and -- whew -- we think it’s him."" Hamlet say, ""Oh, are you sure it’s my pop? Did he have matty gray hair with a bald spot on top? Did he have bright blue eyes that never know fearAnd a tattoo says GERTRUDE FOREVER right here?""They say, ""Hey, the thing just flittered by our station, We didn’t give him no phyical examination. And we don’t know for sure if your daddy was the one, But we do know a motherfuckin’ ghost when we see one."" Hamlet say, ""Show me where you spied this spectral klunkSo I see if it’s my pop, or if you was both drunk."" So they bring ol’ Hamlet to the spot, and thenThey wait five minutes and wooooo ---Here he comes again. He got gray skin, black teeth and hollow eyes, Beckonin’ like this -- young Hamlet cries, ""Hold, spirit of darness, are you a ghostly apparition?"" ""No,"" says the ghost, ""I look like this from malnutrition. Of course I’m a ghost, but sone, don’t be scared, And I’ll tell you some shit that’ll fry your hair.""He says, ""You got two relatives, I won’t say which, But one’s a bloody murderer and one’s a faithless bitch. Why, I was takin’ a nap in the garden right here, When my ambitious brother pours some poison in my ear. And before my body’s even cold he’s wearin’ my pajamas, Layin’ up in my bed with my crown on his head, Doin’ somethin’ sinful to your momma. And the terrible thoughts of what they’re doin’ up thereIs more than a poor old ghost can bear. So you gotta revenge me on this harlot and this knaveOr else I’ll never rest in my motherfuckin’ grave.""Well, this information just flips Hamlet out. He starts walkin’ like this, with spit hangin’ out his mouth. His eyes are all bleary and his tongue looks worse, And he’s talkin’ in couplets and blank fuckin’ verse. I mean the dude is indecisive, He don’t know how he’d like his eggs, And he’s got no opinion on tits, ass or legs. He can’t decide which horse to play at the track, And when they ask him what suit you wanna wear today? He say, ""Ah…um…gimme the black."" He calls his uncle a murderer, Calls his momma a whore, And he can’t get it up for Ophelia no more. Oh, and Ophelia? She’s tryin’ her bestTo make him feel better, Wants to polish his crown jewels, But he won’t let her. ""Stead of sayin’ yea, the fool says nay, And the whole court’s figurin’ he must be gay.Well, then in come Hamlet’s oldest friends, Rosenstern and Guildencrantz, They say, ""Hey there, Ham, you gloomy Gus, Get up – get down – and party with us. We brought you some actores, Some tunes and some lyricsTo put on a play to boost up your spirits."" Hamlet says, ""Hey – songs and skits, That gives me an idea that could stir up some shit. We’ll put on a play –""N"" that could be just the thingTo catch the conscience of the king, If there is a conscience in the motherfuckin’ king.""So Hamlet calls all the actors, he say, ""’Fore this drama starts, I’m gonna tell you suckers how to play your parts. You gotta speak the speech like I pronounced it –Don’t rush it, don’t milk it, don’t drag it, don’t bounce it. I mean, do it trippingly on the tongue, Or else I’ll see your thespian asses strung up and hung. And don’t saw the air with your hands flappin’ wild, ""N’ don’t go mouthin’ my words in some method style.""Then the lead actor says, ""Hey – are we alive?Or just some talking meat that’s gotta listen to this jive?I have read this thing you call a scriptAnd it ain’t too bad, it’s got a few little dips. But with some new dialogue and a few minor edits –Hey, do you mind sharing writer credits? But this part about the king? -- poisoning his brother? I play this wile the real king’s watchin’? Sittin’ with your mother? You must be out of your cotton-pickin’ mind. He’ll cut out my tongue, he’ll gouge out my eyes, He’ll boil me in oil and send me to hell."" Hamlet says, ""How about double scale?"" – The actor says, ""Well…""I want my name above the title, three percent of the gross, I want that tall brunette as my dialogue coach. I want approval of director and a juicy per diem, And if there’s changes in the script, I got to see ‘em. I want a dresser, and undresser and a hairdresser, too, And I gotta-gotta-gotta have the biggest dressing room. I want an escape clause that lets me out in a month, And the first thing I insist is that you fire that cunt. I want transportation to and from every show, I want complimentary tickets for everybody I know. I want my brother and my cousin hired to play in the band, And don’t go tryin’ to sneak in any extra matinees. And next time you wanna speak to me, Check with the director first. Now will you please go away and let us rehearse?"" So Hamlet slinks off, lookin’ for a backer, Mutterin’ how he’ll never ever talk to another fuckin’ actor. And him and Horatio, they walk down a ways, Till they see some clown diggin’ a mouldy grave. Hamlet picks up a skull, he says, ""Who was this sucker?"" They say, ""Yorick."" He says, ""Yorick? I knew the motherfucker. He used to be court jester. Hey, Yorick, show us howYou used to make them funny faces – Why ain’t you laughin’ now? I’ve kissed these lips, I know not how oft."" And Horatio quips, ""Hey, let’s not announce how oft you kissed them lips. I mean people already talkin’ ‘bout the way you walk, And the fact that you ain’t givin’ Ophelia no nook.""Oh, and speakin’ of Ophelia – Polonius, her daddy, Says, ""Hey, that prince is drivin’ my little girl batty. Got her runnin’ all night and sleepin’ till noon, God knows what else he got her doin’. But he’s our royal prince, lord of earth, sky and water, But he’s also a horny little pimply-faced shitheadTrying to hump my daughter."" So Polonius calls Ophelia and says, ""Listen, darlin’ daughter, I hope you and Ham ain’t doin’ things you shouldn’t oughter, ‘Cause you let ‘em touch an ankle and they wanna grab a knee, And they never buy nothin’ that you let ‘em have for free.""Ophelia says, ""Hey, Pop, I know the score, You think I wanna wind up another palace whore? I got the dud sendin’ me letters and babblin’ ‘bout the moon, I really do think his bells are out of tune."" ""Well, don’t you go dingin’ his bells,"" says Polonius, ""’’Cause if he throws you in the grass, I’ll get your big brother Laertes to kick his royal ass.""Now Laertes overhears his name bein’ bandied about, He says, ""Hey, Pop, you signin’ my ass up for somethin’My head don’t know about?"" Plonius says, ""Son, it’s Hamlet, that loony tune, Been fed all his life with a silver spoon. He’s in my face and on my neck, I mean the dude ain’t playin’ with a full damn deck. He’s bumblin’ around twirlin’ his crown, And callin’ me a fishmonger all over town. And he’s charmed your baby sister with his rhymes and his riddles. Hey, you think she’s puttin’ on a little weight around the middle?"" Laertes says, ""Hey, Pop, she ain’t no baby, She got a set of jugs tha’d drive any prince crazy. Now that’s just a natural fact and not lust or incest, And if she shakes ‘em right, she could be a princess."" ""That’s right,"" says Ophelia. ""That’s my scheme, And the way kings been dyin’ ‘round here, I could wind up queen."" ""Enough,"" says Polonius. ""That Pince has ruined my day. Now we gotta see his fuckin’ play within a play. Hell, the place’ll be drafty, the seats won’t be com’fa’ble, I wouldn’t go at all but these tickets ain’t refundable. Prob’ly full of symbolism, I won’t understand it, Shit, I hope it rains and all the critics pan it.""So they go to the play and everybody’s there. They got diamonds on their doublets, They got ribbons in their hair. Lords, ladies, dogs, babies, all in attendance, The marquee says MURDER, DECEIT AND VENGEANCE. ONE OF YEAR’S TEN BEST. DO NOT MISS IT.So everybody figures it’s another piece of shit. And they’re bitchin’ ‘bout their seats, buckin’ the line, Scalpin’ tickets and sippin’ wine, Rattlin’ their programs, twistin’ in their chairs, Tryin’ to catch if any celebrities are there. Then the play begins – and ooh, looky here –It shows the king puttin’ poison in his brother’s ear. And King Claudius is watchin’, and -- ooh -- is he pissed. He says, ""I know who’s responsible for this."" He calls, ""Hey Gertie, come here, hon. What the hell’s the matter with your jive-ass son? I give the kid room, board ‘n’ remedial education, And he calls me a murderer, and other wild accusations. Hell, I’d sue him for libel for implyin’ that shit. But the libel laws ain’t been invented yet. Just ‘cause I’m bangin’ you, he’s givin’ me hell, I think he wants to hump you his own damn self.""Queen Gertrude says, ""I think he’s goin’ throughAn Oedipal rejection, seein’ his uncleReplace his father in his momma’s affection."" ""Oedipal?"" says the king. ""The punk is givin’ me some shit.I’ll send him where I sent his pop if he don’t quit.So you tell him it’s better to leave some things unsaid,Or he’ll be puttin’ on his crown without his motherfuckin’ head."" So the queen runs to Hamlet, she says, ""Oh listen, son, Y’better suck up to the king before some foul deed gets done.It’s true he wears black socks and Hawaiian shirts,But that ain’t no reason to treat him like dirt,Because he is your uncle, and I do wear his ring,And most of all, he is the motherfuckin’ king."" ""Don’t say mother-fuckin’ king,"" says Hamlet. ""Please, Somehow that phrase makes my blood freeze. My daddy was a handsome dude with dignity and class, And this fat fool got hair on his back and boils on his ass. Can anybody get you in their goddamn bedJust ‘cause they got a crown on their goddamned head?"" His momma says, ""Hey, before you go off the deep end, There’s some things about women you gotta comprehend.""Now milkmaids and queens, we all have filet mignon dreams, But when the steak is gone, you will eat the beans. And when you’re out of beans, you’ll chew the shoes off their feet, But you eat. Just picture me – a sweet young thing, Then boom – my husband’s dead – and this sucker’s king. So it’s ‘heat the meat and act real sweet’Or wind up with my ass out in the goddamned street. I got cellulite, I got varicose veins, I got a hip gets stiff every time it rains. And -- this -- is what nursing a baby can do, ""Course, honey, I’m not blamin’ you, Though you were such a hungry child, But life goes on and a queen must smile.""Then hark – just then Hamlet hears a soundFrom behind the curtain – like a mouse skitt’rin’ ‘round.But it’s really Ophelia’s daddy, spyin’ for the king,Listenin’ and takin’ down everything.Hamlet yells, ""A rat!"" and he stabs at the place,And kerplunk, out falls Polonius on his eavedroppin’ face.Hamlet sees it ain’t the king, he says, ""Oh shit,Y’finally do take action and this is what you get.Now I killed my girlfriend’s poppa and I’m covered with his blood,How do you explain this to someone you love?""Then here comes Ophelia, callin’, ""Daddy, Daddy dear,Hamlet, is my daddy in here?"" Well…he is… and he ain’t – but someone should have told the catY’don’t wanna get stabbed, don’t make noise like a rat.She cries, ""Oh, my daddy’s dead and I can see You stuck it in him like you stuck it in me. I can’t believe the shit you done to me. You used to want all – now you want none of me. Is this your perverted way of makin’ fun o’ me?"" Hamlet says, ""Hey then, get thee someplace…Maybe a … a nunnery."" ""Get me to a nunnery?"" Ophelia moans, ""Now that you ate the chicken, you wanna try and hide the bones? With your poetry and promises you messed up my brain, You are a dirty dog – and not a great Dane."" ""Please,"" says Hamlet, ""I’m in a crazed condition. Can’t you see I’m torn by indecision? To be or not to be? That’s the fuckin’ questionThat’s givin’ me migraines and indigestion. Should I take arms against a sea of trouble, Or just walk around goin’ gubble-gubble-gubble?""Ophelia says, ""Hey, you don’t fool me a bit,You’re fakin’ all this psycho shit, ‘Cause if you’re insane you don’t have to kill the king, Or marry me or do any damn thing."" Ham says, ""Hey, go bake a cake, or give your booty a shake,Or take a jump in the motherfuckin’ lake –""Well, that’s where he made another fatal mistake. Y’see he didn’t really mean for the bitch to do it, But she’s gone like a flash, and run, jump, splash, She’s floatin’ and bloatin’ ‘fore anybody knew it.""Oh, when it rains it pours,"" says Hamlet, ""Ain’t no doubt, Here’s another thing I gotta feel guilty about.""Well, they have Ophelia’s funeral and everybody’s there.They got diamonds on their doublet, they got ribbons in their hair. They’re rattlin’ their beads and twistin’ in their chairs, Tryin’ to catch if any celebrities are there. And it’s a pleasant event, until into her graveLeaps her brother Laertes and he rants and raves. He’s shakin’ his fist and pullin’ his hair, Gettin’ his ass tangled up in his underwear, Jumpin’ up and down in a frenzied fit, Meanwhile stompin’ her body to shit. He cries, ""FEE-FO-FI, if I find the guy who caused her to die, I’ll slice him like a pie. I’ll cut out his heart and send it to Peru, ‘N’ I’ll c.o.d. his balls off to Timbuktu, Ship his dick to England in a registered letter, And then let him try to get his shit back together."" Then the king pulls his coat, he says, ""Harken to this, Hamlet’s the dude who fucked up your sis. And he also stabbed your daddy, too, And all you do is boo-hoo-hoo? What kind of brother and son are you?If it was my family I know what I’d do, I’d be on him like a damned tattoo. Now… there is a sword with a poisoned tip. It’ll send any sucker on a one-way trip, ‘Cause all it takes is one itty bitty scratch…Hey, Hamlet, how about a little fencin’ match?""Well, then the whole fuckin’ place caves in, Hamlet stabs Laertes and Laertes stabs him. Then Hamlet turns around and stabs his uncle, too, While the queen drinks some poison the king had brewed. So she dies, he dies, Hamlet dies, Laertes diesOn top of where Ophelia lies, Right next to where Polonius died. And before you can wink, blink or turn your head, Chop-stab-slice -- every motherfucker’s dead.Then in walks this cat Fortinbras, he says, ""What – is -- this?I have never seen such a fuckin’ mess. You got skulls and swords, you got guts and gore, You got bodies piled up from ceiling to floor. You got broken glass, y’got tangled hairs, You got blood and wine runnin’ down the stairs. You got dented armor and ripped up gowns, You got bent-up crowns just rollin’ ‘round. Y’got a punctured king, y’got a poisoned queen, Y’got a sweet prince dyin’ on the mezzanine. And behind that curtain there’s another dead duff, And a body from the fishpond just floated up. Y’got a stiff in the garden with some gunk in his ear, And a tatto says GERTRUDE FOREVER right here, And two guards on the gate tower drunk on beer. What the hell’s been goin’ on here?""Well, that was the end of our sweet prince, He died in confusion and nobody’s seen him since. And the moral of the story is bells do get out of tune…And you can find shit in a silver spoon…And an old man’s revenge can be a young man’s ruin…Oh – and never look too close… at what your mamma is doin'.",English,,"['Poetry', 'Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Humor', 'American', 'Short Stories']",[],Unknown Binding,,18,Playboy,1998,,[],610,"['187', '171', '154', '85', '13']",84.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332653558l/332100.jpg,18,1,

The hero, the semi-autobiographical Ferdinand, moves through the nightmare of London's underworld during the years of World War I. In this distressing setting, he meets pimps and prostitutes, pawnbrokers and magicians, policemen and arsonists. He sees social and physiological decomposition as these processes unfold along parallel lines of development. The illusions of existence are nakedly exposed. The narrative erupts in Céline's characteristic elliptical style. His splintered sentences and scatology reflect his fury at the fragmentation of experience and at his own impotence in the face of it. Out of his rage, he forces the meaninglessness back on itself, and the exuberance of his struggle triumphs in the comic exaggeration of satire. Ultimately, his subject is not death but life, and he responds to it by a strengthened commitment to the sensual and concrete. His hallucinatory world is so vividly realized that it does, indeed, challenge the reality of the reader's more conventional world.",English,9780811200189,"['Fiction', 'France', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'French Literature', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Classics']",[],Paperback,,284,New Directions,January 17th 1969,April 1944,[],973,"['251', '358', '261', '74', '29']",89.0,"['London, England']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347263374l/226954.jpg,18,1,7.12

And in a new chapter on the post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Knightley details even greater degrees of government manipulation and media complicity, as evidenced by the ""embedding"" of reporters in military units and the uncritical, openly patriotic coverage of these conflicts.

There, among the cherry blossoms, temples, and crowds, and with the help of an almost-but-definitely-not Harajuku girl, he begins to see how it may not have been ancient magic or mystical treatment that kept his mother going. Perhaps, the secret of how to live lies in how she died.",English,B00A2CF5KQ,"['Young Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Death', 'Teen', 'Travel', 'New Adult', 'Young Adult Contemporary']",[],Kindle Edition,,264,"Little, Brown",June 4th 2013,,[],3694,"['1201', '1166', '924', '296', '107']",89.0,"['Tokyo (Japan)', 'Los Angeles, California (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349989139l/12157780.jpg,18,1,
8041711-the-boys-from-little-mexico,The Boys from Little Mexico: A Season Chasing the American Dream,,Steve Wilson,3.91,"The all Hispanic boys' soccer team from Woodburn High has made the playoffs for nineteen straight years. As they prepare to make it twenty, the boys are determined that this will be the season they beat the wealthy suburban schools around them and finally win the Oregon state championship. Their spirited drive gives a rare sense of hope and unity to a bluecollar farming community that has been transformed by waves of immigrants over recent decades, a town locals call ""Little Mexico.""In 2005, Woodburn High's Bulldogs, aka Los Perros, will start the season with eight undocumented students, three boys who speak almost no English, a midfielder groomed to play for a pro Mexican team, a goalkeeper living in his third foster home, and an Irishdescended white coach desperate to lead all of them to success. Watched over by a south Texas transplant—a surrogate father to half the squad—this band of brothers must learn to come together on the field and look after each other off it.More than just riveting sports writing, The Boys from Little Mexico is also about the fight for the future of the next generation and a hard, true look at boys dismissed as gangbangers, told to ""go home"" by lilywhite sideline crowds. At school, these kids battle academically in a country where barely half of all Hispanic boys graduate and fewer still make it to college. Now, in a gutsy quest for their first state championship, one thing will become clear: Los Perros play the beautiful game with heart, pride, and their lives on the line. The wins and losses they notch along the way spin a striking and fastpaced tale of how sometimes it takes more than raw talent, discipline, and passion to capture the American Dream.",English,9780807021675,"['Nonfiction', 'Sports', 'Soccer', 'Historical']",[],Hardcover,,256,Beacon Press,June 1st 2010,,[],106,"['29', '43', '29', '5', '0']",95.0,"['Woodburn, Oregon (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320478698l/8041711.jpg,18,1,5.20

Looking for a new world to call their own, they brought with them a rich mélange of cultures, religions, and dialects from a far-off planet called Earth. Mighty were the old-fathers, with the power to shape the world to their liking—but that was many generations ago, and what was once known has long been lost.

Jackson (Editor)",4.18,"Samuel Taylor Coleridge, poet, critic, and radical thinker, exerted an enormous influence over contemporaries as varied as Wordsworth, Southey and Lamb. He was also a dedicated reformer, and set out to use his reputation as a public speaker and literary philosopher to change the course of English thought.This collection represents the best of Coleridge's poetry from every period of his life, particularly his prolific early years, which produced The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Christabel, and Kubla Khan. The central section of the book is devoted to his most significant critical work, Biographia Literaria, and reproduces it in full. It provides a vital background for both the poetry section which precedes it and for the shorter prose works which follow. There is also a generous sample of his letters, notebooks, and marginalia, some recently discovered, which show a different, more spontaneous side to his fascinating and complex personality.About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Armed with the extraordinary new discoveries about our genes, Ridley turns his attention to the nature versus nurture debate to bring the first popular account of the roots of human behaviour. What makes us who we are?In February 2001 it was announced that the genome contains not 100,000 genes as originally expected but only 30,000. This startling revision led some scientists to conclude that there are simply not enough human genes to account for all the different ways people behave: we must be made by nurture, not nature. Matt Ridley argues that the emerging truth is far more interesting than this myth. Nurture depends on genes, too, and genes need nurture. Genes not only predetermine the broad structure of the brain; they also absorb formative experiences, react to social cues and even run memory. after the discovery of the double helix of DNA, Nature via Nurture chronicles a new revolution in our understanding of genes. Ridley recounts the hundred years' war between the partisans of nature and nurture to explain how this paradoxical creature, the human being, can be simultaneously free-willed and motivated by instinct and culture. Nature via Nurture is an enthralling, up-to-the-minute account of how genes build brains to absorb experience.",English,9781841157467,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Psychology', 'Evolution', 'Genetics', 'Popular Science', 'Anthropology', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology']",[],Paperback,,328,Harper Perennial,May 1st 2004,2003,[],3833,"['1450', '1440', '728', '156', '59']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348690229l/80035.jpg,18,1,4.56

In Fontamara, Bread and Wine, and The Seed Beneath the Snow - presented together for the first time in English to mark the centenary of the author's birth - Silone narrates the struggles of the cafoni, the farmers and peasants of his native Abruzzo, against poverty, natural disasters, and totalitarianism. The first novel in the series, Fontamara, is a political fable that portrays the bitter trials of the villagers of Pescina as they battle with landowners who have appropriated their only source of water. First published from his exile in Zurich in 1933, and banned in his own country, the novel was translated into twenty languages and won Silone instant international literary fame. Silone's masterpiece, Bread and Wine, introduces the semi-autobiographical character Pietro Spina, an anti-Fascist revolutionary who returns to his homeland after fifteen years in exile. He seeks refuge among the Abruzzo peasants by posing as the priest Don Paolo Spada.  Pietro's story continues in The Seed Beneath the Snow, Silone's personal favorite in the trilogy.

  While you were sleeping...
With her brother Thomas injured on the battlefront in the Colonies, orphaned Cecilia Harcourt has two unbearable choices: move in with a maiden aunt or marry a scheming cousin. Instead, she chooses option three and travels across the Atlantic, determined to nurse her brother back to health. But after a week of searching, she finds not her brother but his best friend, the handsome officer Edward Rokesby. He's unconscious and in desperate need of her care, and Cecilia vows that she will save this soldier's life, even if staying by his side means telling one little lie...
  I told everyone I was your wife
When Edward comes to, he's more than a little confused. The blow to his head knocked out six months of his memory, but surely he would recall getting married. He knows who Cecilia Harcourt is—even if he does not recall her face—and with everyone calling her his wife, he decides it must be true, even though he'd always assumed he'd marry his neighbor back in England.
  If only it were true...
Cecilia risks her entire future by giving herself—completely—to the man she loves.

Not to mention her three intensely loyal Labs. But Fiona got to this point by surviving a nightmare.Several years ago, she was the only survivor of a serial killer — a madman who stalked and abducted young women, strangled them, and left them buried with a red scarf on their bodies. As authorities were closing in on the Red Scarf Killer, he shot and killed Fiona's cop fiancé and his K-9 partner.On Orcas Island, Fiona has found the peace and solitude she needed to rebuild her life. Yet all that changes on the day Simon Doyle barrels up her drive, desperate for her help. He's the reluctant owner of an out-of-control puppy, foisted upon him by his mother. Jaws has eaten through Simon's house, and he's at his wit's end.To Fiona, Jaws is nothing she can't handle. Simon is another matter. A newcomer to Orcas, he's a rugged and intensely private artist, known for creating exquisite furniture. Simon never wanted a puppy, and he most definitely doesn't want a woman. Besides, the lanky redhead is not his type. But tell that to the laws of attraction.As Fiona embarks on training Jaws and as Simon begins to appreciate both dog and trainer, the past tears back into Fiona's life.

1032019.Bad_Samaritans,Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism,,Ha-Joon Chang,4.18,"A rising young star in the field of economics attacks the free-trade orthodoxy of The World Is Flat head-on—a crisp, contrarian history of global capitalism.One economist has called Ha-Joon Chang ""the most exciting thinker our profession has turned out in the past fifteen years."" With Bad Samaritans, this provocative scholar bursts into the debate on globalization and economic justice. Using irreverent wit, an engagingly personal style, and a battery of examples, Chang blasts holes in the ""World Is Flat"" orthodoxy of Thomas Friedman and other liberal economists who argue that only unfettered capitalism and wide-open international trade can lift struggling nations out of poverty. On the contrary, Chang shows, today's economic superpowers—from the U.S. to Britain to his native Korea—all attained prosperity by shameless protectionism and government intervention in industry. We have conveniently forgotten this fact, telling ourselves a fairy tale about the magic of free trade and—via our proxies such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization—ramming policies that suit ourselves down the throat of the developing world.Unlike typical economists who construct models of how the marketplace should work, Chang examines the past: what has actually happened. His pungently contrarian history demolishes one pillar after another of free-market mythology. We treat patents and copyrights as sacrosanct—but developed our own industries by studiously copying others' technologies. We insist that centrally planned economies stifle growth—but many developing countries had higher GDP growth before they were pressured into deregulating their economies. Both justice and common sense, Chang argues, demand that we reevaluate the policies we force on nations that are struggling to follow in our footsteps.",English,9781596913998,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Business', 'Finance', 'International Relations', 'Political Science', 'Money', 'Audiobook']",[],Hardcover,,288,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,December 26th 2007,July 5th 2007,[],4235,"['1791', '1658', '606', '136', '44']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312041078l/1032019.jpg,17,1,4.60

1385708.Dragonfly,Dragonfly: NASA and the Crisis Aboard Mir,,Bryan Burrough,4.0,"On 2/12/97, two Russian cosmonauts joined an American astronaut on board the only permanent manned space outpost, the 11-year-old Mir. It was to be a routine mission, the 4th of seven trips to Mir that NASA astronauts would take as dress rehearsals for the two countries' partnership in a new Intern'l Space Station they were building back on Earth. But there'd been bad omens: a Moscow psychic who predicted a mysterious disaster; a Russian doctor who warned that the crew was psychologically incompatible. Within two weeks the omens were borne out, as the three were suddenly forced to fight the worst fire in space history. This was only the beginning of what became the most dangerous mission in the 36-year history of manned space travel--a 6-month misadventure that would climax in the most harrowing accident faced in space since Apollo 13. In Dragonfly, bestselling author Burrough tells the story of how a joint Russian-American crew narrowly survived almost every trauma imaginable: fire, power blackouts, chemical leaks, docking failures, nail-biting spacewalks & constant mechanical breakdowns, all climaxing in a dramatic midspace collision that left all on board scrambling for their lives. Based on hundreds of hours of interviews with the cosmonauts, astronauts, ground controllers, psychologists & scientists involved, Dragonfly is the saga of a mission as fraught with political & bureaucratic intrigues as any DC potboiler. Using never-before-released internal NASA memoranda, flight logs & debriefings, Burrough portrays a US space program in which many astronauts refuse to raise safety concerns for fear they'll be frozen out of future missions. It offers an unprecedented look inside the rattletrap Russian space program, where the desperate thirst for hard currency leads to safety shortcuts as exhausted, puppetlike cosmonauts endure inhuman pressures from their unfeeling, all-powerful masters on the ground. In Dragonfly, the American astronauts who journeyed to Mir speak out about the failings of the program, from the rigors of training at Russia's Star City military base to the slapdash experiments they were required to perform. Yet thru it all the men & women of the two space programs persevered, forging friendships that will serve them well as the two countries prepare for the 1st launches of the Intern'l Space Station in late 1998. Theirs is a story of a triumph over adversity, destined to be one of the most enduring & widely celebrated adventure stories of our time.",English,9781841150871,"['Space', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Astronomy', 'Politics', 'Biography', 'Journalism', 'Biography Memoir']",[],Hardcover,,418,,January 7th 1999 ,January 16th 1997,[],584,"['199', '233', '118', '23', '11']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1183162444l/1385708.jpg,17,1,3.43

It brings together a unique combination of Byron's poetry and prose - all the major poems, complemented by important letters, journals, and conversations - to give the essence of his work and thinking.

Gas lamps still flicker in the city streets, but the miracle of electric light is in its infancy. The person who controls the means to turn night into day will make history--and a vast fortune. A young untested lawyer named Paul Cravath, fresh out of Columbia Law School, takes a case that seems impossible to win. Paul's client, George Westinghouse, has been sued by Thomas Edison over a billion-dollar question: Who invented the light bulb and holds the right to power the country? The case affords Paul entry to the heady world of high society--the glittering parties in Gramercy Park mansions, and the more insidious dealings done behind closed doors. The task facing him is beyond daunting. Edison is a wily, dangerous opponent with vast resources at his disposal--private spies, newspapers in his pocket, and the backing of J. P. Morgan himself. Yet this unknown lawyer shares with his famous adversary a compulsion to win at all costs. How will he do it?In obsessive pursuit of victory, Paul crosses paths with Nikola Tesla, an eccentric, brilliant inventor who may hold the key to defeating Edison, and with Agnes Huntington, a beautiful opera singer who proves to be a flawless performer on stage and off.

This vast parade often goes unnoticed, except in a few places where these small travelers concentrate in large numbers. One such place is along Lake Erie in northwestern Ohio. There, the peak of spring migration is so spectacular that it attracts bird watchers from around the globe, culminating in one of the world’s biggest birding festivals.     Millions of winged migrants pass through the region, some traveling thousands of miles, performing epic feats of endurance and navigating with stunning accuracy. Now climate change threatens to disrupt patterns of migration and the delicate balance between birds, seasons, and habitats. But wind farms—popular as green energy sources—can be disastrous for birds if built in the wrong places.

Her dress, her fiancé and the location—the idyllic holiday ranch in Brazil—are perfect.  But all Aimee’s plans come crashing down when the private jet that’s taking her from the U.S. to the ranch—where her fiancé awaits her—defects mid-flight and the pilot is forced to perform an emergency landing in the heart of the Amazon rainforest.  With no way to reach civilisation, being rescued is Aimee and Tristan’s—the pilot—only hope. A slim one that slowly withers away, desperation taking its place. Because death wanders in the jungle under many forms: starvation, diseases. Beasts.  As Aimee and Tristan fight to find ways to survive, they grow closer. Together they discover that facing old, inner agonies carved by painful pasts takes just as much courage, if not even more, than facing the rainforest.  Despite her devotion to her fiancé, Aimee can’t hide her feelings for Tristan—the man for whom she’s slowly becoming everything. You can hide many things in the rainforest. But not lies. Or love.  Withering Hope is the story of a man who desperately needs forgiveness and the woman who brings him hope.

142849.Madhur_Jaffrey_s_World_Vegetarian,Madhur Jaffrey's World Vegetarian: More Than 650 Meatless Recipes from Around the World,,Madhur Jaffrey,4.08,"In her most comprehensive volume yet, Madhur Jaffrey draws on more than four decades of culinary adventures, travels, and experimentation for a diverse collection that both intrigues and delights the palate. Dishes from five continents touch on virtually all the world's best loved flavors, for a unsurpassed selection of vegetarian fare.        More than 650 recipes exemplify Madhur's unsurpassed ability to create simple, flavorful homecooking that is well within the reach of every cook. Extensive sections on Beans, Vegetables, Grains, and Dairy explore the myriad ways these staples are enjoyed worldwide. Each section opens with a detailed introduction; Madhur describes methods for preparation and storage, as well as different cooking techniques and their cultural origins. Throughout she balances appealing, uncomplicated dishes such as sumptuous omelets and rich polentas with less familiar ingredients such as green mangoes, pigeon peas, and spelt. Madhur demystifies the latter with clear-cut explanations so that incorporating new combinations and interesting flavors into everyday cooking becomes second nature. She also offers substantial sections on Soups, Salads, and Drinks, as well as Sauces and Other Flavorings, to help round out a meatless meal and add exciting new flavors to even the most easily prepared dishes.

In his very own words Burgundy reveals his most private thoughts, his triumphs and his disappointments. His life reads like an adventure story complete with knock down fights, beautiful women and double-fisted excitement on every page. He has hunted jackalopes with Bobby Kennedy and Peter Lawford, had more than his share of his amorous exploits, and formed the greatest on-air team in the history of televised news. Along the way, he hobnobbed with people you wish you knew and some you honestly wish you didn't -- celebrities, presidents, presidents' wives, celebrities' wives, dogs, and, of course Veronica Corningstone, the love of his life. Walter Cronkite, Barbra Streisand, Katie Couric, the list goes on. Who didn’t Mr. Burgundy, or “Ron” as he is known to his friends, rub elbows with in the course of his colorful and often criminal life? This may well be the most thrilling book ever written, by a man of great physical, moral and spiritual strength and not surprisingly a great literary talent as well.

Hausfrauhaus·frau \haus-frau\ n 1: Origin: German.Housewife, homemaker. 2: A married woman. 3: A novel by Jill Alexander Essbaum Anna was a good wife, mostly. Anna Benz, an American in her late thirties, lives with her Swiss husband, Bruno—a banker—and their three young children in a postcard-perfect suburb of Zürich. Though she leads a comfortable, well-appointed life, Anna is falling apart inside. Adrift and increasingly unable to connect with the emotionally unavailable Bruno or even with her own thoughts and feelings, Anna tries to rouse herself with new experiences: German language classes, Jungian analysis, and a series of sexual affairs she enters with an ease that surprises even her. But Anna can't easily extract herself from these affairs. When she wants to end them, she finds it's difficult. Tensions escalate, and her lies start to spin out of control. Having crossed a moral threshold, Anna will discover where a woman goes when there is no going back. Intimate, intense, and written with the precision of a Swiss Army knife, Jill Alexander Essbaum's debut novel is an unforgettable story of marriage, fidelity, sex, morality, and most especially self.

Kaga ging in den Polizeidienst, während Nonoguchi den Lehrerberuf an den Nagel hängte, um sich mit mäßigem Erfolg dem Schreiben zu widmen. Im Laufe der Ermittlungen findet Kaga Hinweise, dass die Beziehung der beiden Schriftsteller alles andere als freundschaftlich war. Doch die eigentliche Frage ist nicht wer oder wie, sondern warum. Wenn Kaga kein Motiv für den Mord nachweisen kann, wird die Wahrheit nie ans Licht kommen.

A broken mating bond has him going insane, and all he can do is try to hold onto his Alpha position as long as possible. But when a spirited beauty comes waltzing into his MC’s clubhouse demanding an audience with him, he can’t help but think he’s dreaming her up. She’s got paperwork saying he’s her mate, and this shifter has one serious stubborn streak in her. All he wants to do is go insane in peace, but she isn’t having it. And now the real work begins. He’s got to sever one mating bond completely if he wants a shot at survival. And if this crazy plan works, he might just have a second shot at happiness too.  Vina wants a crow.

The half-crazed Alpha of the biggest, baddest Clan of crow shifters in existence isn’t going to make pairing up easy. And the more Vina gets to know him, the more she thinks it wasn’t him who signed up for a mate after all.

21936809-the-kind-worth-killing,The Kind Worth Killing,,Peter Swanson (Goodreads Author),4.03,"A devious tale of psychological suspense involving sex, deception, and an accidental encounter that leads to murder. Fans of Paula Hawkins’ The Girl on the Train will love this modern reimagining of Patricia Highsmith’s classic Strangers on a Train from the author of the acclaimed The Girl with a Clock for a Heart—which the Washington Post said “should be a contender for crime fiction’s best first novel of 2014.”On a night flight from London to Boston, Ted Severson meets the stunning and mysterious Lily Kintner. Sharing one too many martinis, the strangers begin to play a game of truth, revealing very intimate details about themselves. Ted talks about his marriage that’s going stale and his wife Miranda, who he’s sure is cheating on him. Ted and his wife were a mismatch from the start—he the rich businessman, she the artistic free spirit—a contrast that once inflamed their passion, but has now become a cliché.But their game turns a little darker when Ted jokes that he could kill Miranda for what she’s done. Lily, without missing a beat, says calmly, “I’d like to help.” After all, some people are the kind worth killing, like a lying, stinking, cheating spouse. . . .Back in Boston, Ted and Lily’s twisted bond grows stronger as they begin to plot Miranda's demise. But there are a few things about Lily’s past that she hasn’t shared with Ted, namely her experience in the art and craft of murder, a journey that began in her very precocious youth.Suddenly these co-conspirators are embroiled in a chilling game of cat-and-mouse, one they both cannot survive . . . with a shrewd and very determined detective on their tail.",English,9780062267528,"['Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Crime', 'Suspense', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Psychological Thriller', 'Contemporary']","['Ted Severson', 'Lily Kintner', 'Miranda Severson', 'Brad Daggett', 'Eric Washburn', 'Detective Kimball']",Hardcover,,311,William Morrow,February 3rd 2015,,"['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Mystery & Thriller (2015)', 'Gullkulen/The Golden Bullet Nominee (2016)']",89723,"['29307', '39693', '16170', '3342', '1211']",95.0,['Maine (United States)'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417981750l/21936809.jpg,16,1,13.88

Evans presents the most important archaeological discoveries that shed light on the world of Jesus of Nazareth. Evans takes on many sensational claims that have been proposed in recent books and peddled in the media, and uses actual archaeological findings to uncover the truth about several key pieces of Jesus' world. For example, what was the village of Nazareth actually like in the time of Jesus? Did synagogues really exist, as the Gospels say? What does archaeology tell us about the ruling priests who condemned Jesus to death? Has the tomb of Jesus really been found, as has been claimed?

How does nature produce the right numbers of zebras and lions on the African savanna, or fish in the ocean? How do our bodies produce the right numbers of cells in our organs and bloodstream? In ""The Serengeti Rules,"" award-winning biologist and author Sean Carroll tells the stories of the pioneering scientists who sought the answers to such simple yet profoundly important questions, and shows how their discoveries matter for our health and the health of the planet we depend upon.One of the most important revelations about the natural world is that everything is regulated--there are rules that regulate the amount of every molecule in our bodies and rules that govern the numbers of every animal and plant in the wild. And the most surprising revelation about the rules that regulate life at such different scales is that they are remarkably similar--there is a common underlying logic of life. Carroll recounts how our deep knowledge of the rules and logic of the human body has spurred the advent of revolutionary life-saving medicines, and makes the compelling case that it is now time to use the Serengeti Rules to heal our ailing planet.A bold and inspiring synthesis by one of our most accomplished biologists and gifted storytellers, ""The Serengeti Rules"" is the first book to illuminate how life works at vastly different scales.

New Directions is excited to reissue the Gardner classics, beginning with October Light, a complex relationship rendered in a down-to-earth narrative.October Light is one of John Gardner's masterworks. The penniless widow of a once-wealthy dentist, Sally Abbot now lives in the Vermont farmhouse of her older brother, 72-year-old James Page. Polar opposites in nearly every way, their clash of values turns a bitter corner when the exacting and resolute James takes a shotgun to his sister's color television set. After he locks Sally up in her room with the trashy ""blockbuster"" novel that has consumed her (and only apples to eat), the novel-within-the-novel becomes an echo chamber providing glimpses into the history of the family that spawned these bizarre, sad, and stubborn people. Gardner uses the turbulent siblings as a stepping-off point from which he expands upon the lives of their extended families, and the rural community that surrounds them.

3147367-american-lion,American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,,Jon Meacham,3.81,"The definitive biography of a larger-than-life president who defied norms, divided a nation, and changed Washington foreverAndrew Jackson, his intimate circle of friends, and his tumultuous times are at the heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern presidency. Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jackson's election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson's presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human drama-the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers- that shaped Jackson's private world through years of storm and victory.One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will- or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White House-from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman-have found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision.Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe-no matter what it took.",English,9781400063253,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Presidents', 'American History', 'Politics', 'Us Presidents', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical', 'Audiobook']","['John Quincy Adams', 'Daniel Webster', 'Andrew Jackson', 'John C.

A cerebral hemorrhage leaves Tony comatose in a hospital ICU. He 'awakens' to find himself in a surreal world, a 'living' landscape that mirrors dimensions of his earthly life, from the beautiful to the corrupt. It is here that he has vivid interactions with others he assumes are projections of his own subconscious, but whose directions he follows nonetheless with the possibility that they might lead to authenticity and perhaps, redemption. The adventure draws Tony into deep relational entanglements where he is able to 'see' through the literal eyes and experiences of others, but is ""blind"" to the consequences of hiding his personal agenda and loss that emerge to war against the processes of healing and trust. Will this unexpected coalescing of events cause Tony to examine his life and realize he built a house of cards on the poisoned grounds of a broken heart?

She has a perspective like that of no other expert in the field, which allows her to offer unparalleled observations and groundbreaking ideas.People with autism can often think the way animals think, putting them in the perfect position to translate ""animal talk.""

And Mickey’s greatestfeats of derring-do took place in his daily comic strip, written and drawn by one of the greatest cartoonists of the 20thcentury — Floyd Gottfredson.For its first quarter-century, Gottfredson’s Mickey Mouse was a rip-roaring serial: the most popular cartoon-basedcomic of its time, a trendsetting adventure continuity aimed at both kids and grown-ups, and the foundation on whichall later Disney comics grew — including the adventures of Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge by Gottfredson’s Disneycolleague Carl Barks.Glimpses of Floyd Gottfredson’s masterpiece have been reprinted over the years, most famously in Bill Blackbeard’sclassic Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics.

Critics, scholars, seasoned Disney archivists, and fellowcartoonists provide commentary and historical essays on the strip’s creation and execution.Walt Disney often said that his studio’s success “all started with a Mouse” — Walt himself wrote the Mickey Mousestrip before turning it over to the able hands of Gottfredson — and today Mickey is among the world’s most recognizableicons.

The readings gathered here join these issues with critical theory to examine the ongoing struggle to rediscover the nature within human beings and to reconnect it with external nature.Starting with an examination of the use of modernist thought as legitimation for the domination of nature, the collection progresses on a broad front: It examines how first-world economies create third-world dependency; the connections between poverty and population; how basic needs could be fulfilled in a green sustainable economy; the debate among deep, social, and socialist ecologists over the new ecological worldview; ecofeminism and the liberation of both women and nature; environmental justice for minorities and third-world peoples; the need for new spiritual relations between people and nature; and a new postmodern science that offers people a partnership with nature. The conclusion presents the ""Principles of Environmental Justice,"" adopted by the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit.Each essay stands on its own as a contribution to the ecological debate, but the cumulative effect is clearly to ask how critical theorists, current environmental philosophers, and scientists propose to liberate both human beings and nature.",English,9781573926003,['Philosophy'],[],Paperback,,397,Humanity Books,August 1st 1994,1994,[],37,"['12', '11', '9', '3', '2']",86.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365463374l/340383.jpg,15,1,5.20

In Breaking the Da Vinci Code: Answers to the Questions Everyone's Asking, Darrell Bock, Ph.D., responds to the novelist's claims using central ancient texts and answers the following questions:Who was Mary Magdalene?Was Jesus Married?Would Jesus Being Single be Un-Jewish?Do the So-Called Secret Gnostic Gospels Help Us Understand Jesus?What Is the Remaining Relevance of The Da Vinci Code?Darrell Bock's research uncovers the origins of these codes by focusing on the 325 years immediately following the birth of Christ, for the claims of The Da Vinci Code rise or fall on the basis of things emerging from this period. Breaking the Da Vinci Code, now available in trade paper, distinguishes fictitious entertainment from historical elements of the Christian faith.

27213168-i-contain-multitudes,I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life,,Ed Yong,4.15,"Every animal, whether human, squid, or wasp, is home to millions of bacteria and other microbes. Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us—the microbiome—build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. In this astonishing book, Ed Yong takes us on a grand tour through our microbial partners, and introduces us to the scientists on the front lines of discovery. Yong, whose humor is as evident as his erudition, prompts us to look at ourselves and our animal companions in a new light—less as individuals and more as the interconnected, interdependent multitudes we assuredly are. The microbes in our bodies are part of our immune systems and protect us from disease. Those in cows and termites digest the plants they eat. In the deep oceans, mysterious creatures without mouths or guts depend on microbes for all their energy. Bacteria provide squids with invisibility cloaks, help beetles to bring down forests, and allow worms to cause diseases that afflict millions of people. I Contain Multitudes is the story of these extraordinary partnerships, between the creatures we are familiar with and those we are not. It reveals how we humans are disrupting these partnerships and how we might manipulate them for our own good. It will change both our view of nature and our sense of where we belong in it.",English,9780062368591,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Health', 'Audiobook', 'Medicine', 'Nature', 'Popular Science', 'Medical', 'Evolution']",[],Hardcover,,368,Ecco,August 9th 2016,,"['Royal Society Science Book Prize Nominee (2017)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Science & Technology (2016)', 'Wellcome Book Prize Nominee (2017)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Science & Technology (2016)']",15586,"['6319', '6254', '2287', '478', '248']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445606162l/27213168.jpg,15,1,10.70

6462.His_Excellency,His Excellency: George Washington,,Joseph J. Ellis,3.92,"To this landmark biography of our first president, Joseph J. Ellis brings the exacting scholarship, shrewd analysis, and lyric prose that have made him one of the premier historians of the Revolutionary era. Training his lens on a figure who sometimes seems as remote as his effigy on Mount Rushmore, Ellis assesses George Washington as a military and political leader and a man whose “statue-like solidity” concealed volcanic energies and emotions.Here is the impetuous young officer whose miraculous survival in combat half-convinced him that he could not be killed.

At age 13, she was sent to Kendall House in Gravesend, Kent, a home which soon became her prison and worst nightmare. Teresa found herself a victim of a terrible regime: she was injected with dangerously high doses of drugs and sexually abused. As a result of this cruel and vicious treatment—accompanied by punishments such as 163 days spent in solitary confinement—it was not long before Teresa began to harm herself and even attempt to take her life. After three years of hell, Teresa thought her nightmare was over but another was about to begin. Teresa survived, however, and today she works to fight against a corrupt social care system.

Shah addresses the nature of assumptions, those that inhibit understanding and those that might be useful at certain stages of study but need to be set aside by the student at a later time in order to progress. This requires a flexibility of approach that is not customary in the West, one cultivated by study and exposure to Sufi ideas. Its a very humorous and lively lecture, full of stories and anecdotes. Among the other topics Shah addresses are the difference between emotionality and spirituality, the danger of looking for easy answers, and the way in which the paths of East and West are converging.

And she cannot join another fudoki, because although she might be able to win a place within another clan, to do so would mean that she would cease to be herself.So a small cat begins an extraordinary journey.

In the words of one contemporary, it divided the world ""into two different Parties, Pamelists and Anti-pamelists,"" even eclipsing the sensational factional politics of the day. Preached for its morality, and denounced as pornography in disguise, it vividly describes a young servant's long resistance to the attempts of her predatory master to seduce her. Written in the voice of its low-born heroine, Pamela is not only a work of pioneering psychological complexity, but also a compelling and provocative study of power and its abuse.

They brought dangerous new thoughts and inventions, ideas that could topple the rigid Imkairan society. Shocked by the harm they were causing, the humans withdrew. Hundreds of years later they are no more than legends. Fenobar, born with a crippled arm is allowed to live only by the grace of his father, the King of Clan Fen. An outcast all his life, he struggles to survive with honor in a world of warriors. Long ago, he chose the Demon, a mythical being, as his secret ally, his source of strength. Then one shows up in his hour of greatest need. Two young men, one human, one Imkaira, are fated to meet. WHEN IS A DEMON NOT A DEMON? The Demon rubbed at his strange sharp nose with the back of one hand. ""I haven't any more supernatural power than you have--really! I'm a very ordinary kind of person. I can't change things, or make them go wrong."" ""Demon, I have been with you for two hands of days, and in that time things have done nothing but go wrong."" ""Like what?"" ""The Axe was subject to raltmichak, we were chased to exhaustion by the Kaymath, we had to cross the Straits of Tyvai, we nearly drowned, we smashed the boat in the Mists of Tyvai, and now we are marooned on a tiny island with no way off."" ""We saved the Axe from the raltmichak, which was never finished on it. We escaped from the Kaymath, we survived crossing the straits, we didn't drown, and the Mists of Tyvai provide us with water,"" replied the Demon, ticking the points off with one long finger. ""What about getting off this island?"" ""I'm thinking on it."" ""Hunh!"" Fenobar snorted. His crest could not fluff because of the sticky residue left from the sea salt, but his ears twitched with amusement. In a voice dripping with overmuch sweetness, Fenobar said, ""So. It is coincidence you trail change behind you like the Sprite of Spring trails flowers."" Purring, he added, ""But if you are not a Demon of Undoing, what are you?"" His ears twitched wildly as he heard the note of helplessness in the Demon's voice when he answered, ""I'm called a human being."" ""And you are from?"" The Demon cleared his throat. Not looking at Fenobar, he mumbled something at the mail in his lap. ""What's that?"" ""We're from another world."" ""Demons are hardly from this one,"" Fenobar said dryly. 'Bit still you say you're not a Demon."" ""Yes."" ""Hunh!"" ""A little wildly, the Demon ran his five-fingered hand through his head fur, which was as stiff and sticky as Fenobar's. It stood up under this attention like a particularly ratty crest. ""I'm a very ordinary kind of of person!"" ""Very ordinary...for a Demon,"" Fenobar agreed. ""For a human!"" the Demon protested. ""You're still a Demon of Undoing, no matter what you call yourself."" ""I call myself Sig,"" the Demon said, a little desperately. ""Human Being Sig?"" Fenobar asked sweetly. ""Sigmund deGama Cook of the tribe of...of...United Stars Interstellar Survey. Human being. As you are Imkairan. ""Oh,"" Fenobar scrubbed at his almost forgotten armor as he thought that over. ""How did humans get here?"" ""We...""Sig gagged on a word and came to a confused stop. ""I can't tell you."" ""Can't or won't?"" ""Won't,"" the Demon admitted miserably. ""You used some kind of magic ritual which permitted you to fly here, not so?"" Fenobar looked up at Sig from under the long hairs of his crest. ""Demons use them all the time."" Sig put his head in his hand, surrendering. ""All right. I'm a Demon."" ""Could you be anything else?"" Fenobar murmured.

In this book Charles Martin, himself a poet, offers a deeper reading of Catullus, revealing the art and intelligence behind the seemingly spontaneous verse. Martin considers Catullus's life, habits of composition, and the circumstances in which he worked. He places him among the modernists of his age, who created a new ironic and subjective poetics, and he shows the affinity between Catullus and the modernists of our own age. Martin offers original interpretations of Catullus's poems, viewing the love poems to ""Lesbia"" as a unified, artfully arranged poetic sequence, and the short poems, often dismissed as unworthy of serious critical attention, as the irreverent products of a sophisticated poetic innovator.  Unlike Horace, Virgil, and Ovid, Catullus did not influence our literary culture until the beginning of the modern era, but he is now regarded as a poet who speaks to our age with a singular directness. Pointing to Catullus's self-awareness, playfulness, and comic invention and to the elaborate complexity of his experiments in poetic form, Martin gives both the scholar and the general reader a fresh appreciation of his poetic art.",English,9780300052008,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Nonfiction', 'Roman', 'Literature', 'Literary Criticism', 'Classical Studies']",[],Paperback,,192,Yale University Press,May 27th 1992,January 1st 1904,[],150,"['69', '53', '17', '8', '3']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347655909l/964427.jpg,14,1,5.70

886232.Harriet_Tubman,Harriet Tubman: The Life and the Life Stories,,Jean M. Humez,3.85,"    Harriet Tubman’s name is known world-wide and her exploits as a self-liberated Underground Railroad heroine are celebrated in children’s literature, film, and history books, yet no major biography of Tubman has appeared since 1943. Jean M. Humez’s comprehensive Harriet Tubman is both an important biographical overview based on extensive new research and a complete collection of the stories Tubman told about her life—a virtual autobiography culled by Humez from rare early publications and manuscript sources. This book will become a landmark resource for scholars, historians, and general readers interested in slavery, the Underground Railroad, the Civil War, and African American women.    Born in slavery in Maryland in or around 1820, Tubman drew upon deep spiritual resources and covert antislavery networks when she escaped to the north in 1849. Vowing to liberate her entire family, she made repeated trips south during the 1850s and successfully guided dozens of fugitives to freedom. During the Civil War she was recruited to act as spy and scout with the Union Army. After the war she settled in Auburn, New York, where she worked to support an extended family and in her later years founded a home for the indigent aged. Celebrated by her primarily white antislavery associates in a variety of private and public documents from the 1850s through the 1870s, she was rediscovered as a race heroine by woman suffragists and the African American women’s club movement in the early twentieth century. Her story was used as a key symbolic resource in education, institutional fundraising, and debates about the meaning of ""race"" throughout the twentieth century.    Humez includes an extended discussion of Tubman’s work as a public performer of her own life history during the nearly sixty years she lived in the north. Drawing upon historiographical and literary discussion of the complex hybrid authorship of slave narrative literature, Humez analyzes the interactive dynamic between Tubman and her interviewers. Humez illustrates how Tubman, though unable to write, made major unrecognized contributions to the shaping of her own heroic myth by early biographers like Sarah Bradford. Selections of key documents illustrate how Tubman appeared to her contemporaries, and a comprehensive list of primary sources represents an important resource for scholars.",English,9780299191207,"['Biography', 'History']",[],Hardcover,,488,University of Wisconsin Press,November 19th 2003,,[],13,"['4', '4', '4', '1', '0']",92.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347495247l/886232.jpg,14,1,216.85

29362082-the-great-derangement,The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable,,Amitav Ghosh,4.11,"Are we deranged? The acclaimed Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh argues that future generations may well think so. How else to explain our imaginative failure in the face of global warming? In his first major book of nonfiction since In an Antique Land, Ghosh examines our inability—at the level of literature, history, and politics—to grasp the scale and violence of climate change.The extreme nature of today’s climate events, Ghosh asserts, make them peculiarly resistant to contemporary modes of thinking and imagining. This is particularly true of serious literary fiction: hundred-year storms and freakish tornadoes simply feel too improbable for the novel; they are automatically consigned to other genres. In the writing of history, too, the climate crisis has sometimes led to gross simplifications; Ghosh shows that the history of the carbon economy is a tangled global story with many contradictory and counterintuitive elements.Ghosh ends by suggesting that politics, much like literature, has become a matter of personal moral reckoning rather than an arena of collective action. But to limit fiction and politics to individual moral adventure comes at a great cost. The climate crisis asks us to imagine other forms of human existence—a task to which fiction, Ghosh argues, is the best suited of all cultural forms. His book serves as a great writer’s summons to confront the most urgent task of our time.",English,9780226323039,"['Nonfiction', 'Climate Change', 'Environment', 'Science', 'Politics', 'History', 'Nature', 'Sustainability', 'Essays', 'Ecology']",[],Hardcover,,196,University Of Chicago Press,September 14th 2016,July 12th 2016,[],2377,"['934', '924', '405', '86', '28']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1462497923l/29362082._SY475_.jpg,14,1,43.35

One dangerous investigation that forces them to work together.  Blair Mason is badass to the bone. She’s no stranger to loss and barely survived the mission that ended her military career. Now, as part of Team 52, she never shies away from a fight to ensure pieces of powerful ancient technology don’t fall into the wrong hands. Unfortunately, she’s often forced to “liaise” with the team’s contact at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police. The tall, hard-bodied detective ignites her temper quicker than any man she’s ever known…and after a terrible massacre, she’s horrified to find that she and MacKade are being ordered to work together.  Detective Luke MacKade was born a protector. He takes care of his family, and as a dedicated homicide detective, he protects his city. He is less thrilled with his job of cleaning up after Team 52 after they tear through Vegas on a mission. Blair is a woman who sets him off just by breathing, but even he can’t deny the powerful attraction he feels to her strength and skill. When several cursed samurai swords are stolen in a bloody attack, it is up to Luke and Blair to get them back…before more blood is shed.  But others are after the swords and their hidden powers. As Luke and Blair’s dangerous investigation intensifies, they face danger at every turn. Luke battles his intense need to protect the woman he’s falling for, a woman who neither wants or needs his protection. But as their desire burns white-hot, Luke will learn that the toughest defenses are the ones around Blair’s heart.

Wallace",4.0,"New York Times best-selling author Darrell Bock teams with Daniel Wallace to help lay readers separate fact from fiction and help from hype in the recent best-selling Jesus books and television specials.There is a quest going on. It's the quest to reduce Jesus to a mythic legend or to nothing more than a mere man. Scholars such as Elaine Pagels and James Tabor are using such recent discoveries as the Gospel of Judas and the Gospel of Thomas to argue that the Christ of Christianity is a contrived figure and that a different Christ-one human and not divine-is the ""true"" Christ.In his trademark easy-to-understand style Darrell Bock takes on these attempts to redefine Jesus in a convincing, winsome way that will help readers understand that the orthodox understanding of Christ and his divinity is as trustworthy and sure as it ever was. Joining Bock for the first time is fellow scholar Daniel Wallace.

859858.Round_River,Round River,,Aldo Leopold,4.25,"To those who know the grace of Aldo Leopold's writing in A Sand County Almanac, this posthumous collection from his journals and essays will be a new delight. These daily journal entries on hunting, fishing and exploring, written in camp during his many field trips in lower California, New Mexico, Canada, and Wisconsin, indicate the source of Leopold's ideas on land ethics found in his longer essays. The excerpts from these journals—many taken from notes written around a camp fire, spattered with a slapped mosquito or a drop of coffee—show in direct context what he did in his own leisure time. The essays are taken from more contemplative notes which were still in manuscript when Leopold died, fighting a grass fire in 1948. Round River has been edited by Leopold's son, Luna, a geologist well-known in the field of conservation. It is also illustrated throughout with line drawings by Charles W. Schwartz.

878037.The_Book_of_Joby,The Book of Joby,,Mark J. Ferrari,4.15,"The Book of Joby is an epic fantasy complete in one volume. Lucifer and the Creator have entered, yet again, into a wager they've made many times before, but this time, the existence of creation itself is balanced on the outcome. Born in California during the twilight years of a weary millennium, nine year old Joby Peterson dreams of blazing like a bonfire against the gathering darkness of his times, like a knight of the Round Table. Instead, he is subjected to a life of crippling self-doubt and relentless mediocrity inflicted by an enemy he did nothing to earn and cannot begin to comprehend. Though imperiled themselves, the angels are forbidden to intervene. Left to struggle with their own loyalties and the question of obedience, they watch Lucifer work virtually unhindered to turn Joby's heart of gold into ash and stone while God sits by, seemingly unconcerned.  And so when he is grown to manhood, Joby's once luminous love of life seems altogether lost, and Lucifer's victory assured.

Please see the bottom of this description to see if this is the kind of book that you'll love or piss you off**For Luisa Chavez, a twenty-three year old former beauty queen, a better life has always been just out of her reach. Sure, she’s had men at her feet since she was a young teenager but she’s never had the one thing she’s craved – security. Having grown up in near poverty, her waitressing job in Cabo San Lucas can barely let her take care of herself, let alone her ailing parents. Every day is another unwanted advance, every day is a struggle to survive.When Salvador Reyes, the depraved leader of a major Mexican cartel, takes an interest in her, Luisa is presented with an opportunity she can’t afford to pass up. She’ll become Salvador’s wife and exchange her freedom and body for a life of riches – riches she can bestow upon her deserving parents. But Luisa quickly finds out that even the finest wines and jewels can’t undo the ugliness in her marriage, nor the never-ending violence that threatens her every move.Soon, Luisa is looking for an escape, a way out of the carefully controlled life she’s leading. She finally gets her wish in the worst way possible.As it is, being the wife of Salvador makes her an ideal target for rival cartels and there’s one particular man who needs Luisa as part of his cartel’s expansion. One particular man whose quest for power has destroyed lives, slit throats and gotten him out of an American prison. One particular man who will stop at nothing until he gets what he wants.That man is Javier Bernal. And he wants Luisa. He wants to take her, keep her, ruin her.Unless she ruins him first.***WARNING*** This book deals with drug cartels and as such it contains a lot of sex and violence and some violent sex.

Now, in an extraordinary flight of the imagination a half-century in the making, he takes us to a most wondrous destination: into the heart of an Eternal Family.They have lived for centuries in a house of legend and mystery in upper Illinois -- and they are not like other midwesterners. Rarely encountered in daylight hours, their children are curious and wild; their old ones have survived since before the Sphinx first sank its paws deep in Egyptian sands. And some sleep in beds with lids.Now the house is being readied in anticipation of the gala homecoming that will gather together the farflung branches of this odd and remarkable family. In the past-midnight stillness can be detected the soft fluttering of Uncle Einars wings. From her realm of sleep, Cecy, the fairest and most special daughter, can feel the approach of many a welcome being -- shapeshifter, telepath, somnambulist, vampire -- as she flies high in the consciousness of bird and bat.But in the midst of eager anticipation, a sense of doom pervades. For the world is changing. And death, no stranger, will always shadow this most singular family: Father, arisen from the Earth; Mother, who never sleeps but dreams; A Thousand Times Great Grandmére; Grandfather, who keeps the wildness of youth between his ears.And the boy who, more than anyone, carries the burden of time on his shoulders: Timothy, the sad and different foundling son who must share it all, remember, and tell...and who, alone out of all of them, must one day age and wither and die.By turns lyrical, wistful, poignant, and chilling, From the Dust Returned is the long-awaited new novel by the peerless Ray Bradbury -- a book that will surely be numbered among his most enduring masterworks.",English,9780743429986,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Science Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Supernatural', 'Halloween', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Paranormal']",[],Mass Market Paperback,,206,Earthlight (UK),September 2002,2001,"['Bram Stoker Award Nominee for Best Novel (2002)', 'World Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (2002)']",4663,"['1267', '1580', '1331', '382', '103']",90.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374049879l/9634.jpg,13,1,4.34

The final chapters introduce some of the methods used to study the Gospels, including historical, redaction, and narrative criticisms. Bock, a well respected author, provides an informed evangelical alternative to radical projects like the Jesus Seminar. His audience, however, is not limited only to evangelicals. This book, written for college and seminary courses, offers an informed scholarly approach that takes the Gospels seriously as a source of historical information.",English,9780801024511,"['Theology', 'New Testament', 'Christian', 'History', 'Christianity', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical']",[],Paperback,,240,Baker Academic,July 1st 2002,January 1st 2002,[],125,"['26', '59', '31', '8', '1']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387735844l/988894.jpg,13,1,8.53

How Should a Person Be? is a novel of many identities: an autobiography of the mind, a postmodern self-help book, and a fictionalized portrait of the artist as a young woman — of two such artists, in fact.For reasons multiple and mysterious, Sheila finds herself in a quandary of self-doubt, questioning how a person should be in the world. Inspired by her friend Margaux, a painter, and her seemingly untortured ability to live and create, Sheila casts Margaux as material, embarking on a series of recordings in which nothing is too personal, too ugly, or too banal to be turned into art. Along the way, Sheila confronts a cast of painters who are equally blocked in an age in which the blow job is the ultimate art form. She begins questioning her desire to be Important, her quest to be both a leader and a pupil, and her unwillingness to sacrifice herself.Searching, uncompromising and yet mordantly funny, How Should a Person Be? is a brilliant portrait of art-making and friendship from the psychic underground of Canada's most fiercely original writer.",English,9781250032447,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Canada', 'Womens', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Adult', 'Self Help']",[],Paperback,,320,Picador,June 25th 2013,September 25th 2010,"[""Women's Prize for Fiction Nominee for Longlist (2013)"", 'RSL Encore Award Nominee (2013)']",11439,"['1968', '3177', '3225', '2039', '1030']",73.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356403692l/15983331.jpg,13,1,14.51

Maoris knew little of them and cared even less.Not that New Zealand was a sensual paradise. Society encouraged its men in the pursuit of pleasure but adultery, prostitution, incest, alcoholism and sexual ignorance brought misery to many people and often made victims of colonial women. The rise of the puritan movement is frequently thought to have largely eliminated the licentiousness of the earlier period, but this book argues that this was not so. The puritans were vigorous propagandists but they enjoyed only limited success against the vested interests of the liquour trade, the social customs of the majority of New Zealanders and, most significantly, the emerging modern lifestyles of the twentieth century.

This is the book that changed the way the world viewed Michael Jordan, while delivering nonstop excitement, tension, and thrills. The Jordan Rules chronicles the season that changed everything for Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. After losing in the playoffs to the “Bad Boys” Detroit Pistons for three consecutive years, the Bulls finally broke through and swept the Pistons in the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals, on the way to their first NBA championship. Celebrated sportswriter Sam Smith was there for the entire ride. He reveals a candid and provocative picture of Michael Jordan during the season in which his legacy began to be defined, and seeks to figure out what drove him. The Jordan Rules covers everything from his stormy relationships with his coaches and teammates and power struggles with management—including verbal attacks on general manager Jerry Krause and tantrums against coach Phil Jackson—to Jordan’s obsessions with becoming the leading scorer, and his refusal to pass the ball in the crucial minutes of big games. Jordan’s teammates also tell their side of the story, from Scottie Pippen, to Horace Grant, to Bill Cartwright. And Phil Jackson—the former flower child who blossomed into one of the NBA’s top motivators and finally found a way to coax Jordan and the Bulls to their first title—is studied up close. “Smith takes us into the locker room, aboard the team plane and team bus, and seats us on the bench during games. Sometimes, books reflecting on a team’s success don’t reach the personal level with the people who made it happen: The Jordan Rules does” (Associated Press). Discover the team behind the man, and the man behind the living legend, in this intense, fascinating inside story of the incomparable Michael Jordan.",English,9780671796662,"['Sports', 'Nonfiction', 'Basketball', 'Biography', 'History', 'Business', 'African American', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir']",[],Paperback,,384,Pocket Books,January 1st 1993,January 1992,[],14899,"['7645', '4244', '2305', '495', '210']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1434304310l/246468._SY475_.jpg,12,1,10.68

Shakespeare is one of the greatest of all English figures, considered a genius for all time. Yet as this enthralling book shows, he was at heart a man of the theatre, one among a community of artists in the teeming world of Renaissance London - from the enigmatic spy Christopher Marlowe to the self-aggrandizing Ben Jonson, from the actor Richard Burbage to the brilliant Thomas Middleton. By bringing Shakespeare's contemporaries to life, Shakespeare & Co throws fresh new light on the man himself. 
  
'Warm, cheerful, generous . Wells sketches a whole gallery of Shakespeare's fellow playwrights . He brings each vividly to life, making you feel that you've met them personally in some Blackfriars tavern' Simon Callow

Brown advocates an approach to organizing the economy that embraces, rather than skirts, questions of values, sustainability, and inequality. Complementing the award-winning work of Paul Krugman and Jeffrey Sachs, and the paradigm-breaking spirit of Thomas Piketty and Amartya Sen, Brown incorporates the Buddhist emphasis on interconnectedness, capability, and happiness into her vision for a sustainable and compassionate world.Buddhist economics leads us to think mindfully as we go about our daily activities, and offers a way to appreciate how our actions affect the welfare of those around us. By replacing the endless cycle of desire with more positive collective priorities, our lives can become more meaningful as well as happier. Inspired by the popular seminar course Brown developed for UC Berkeley that has garnered international attention, Buddhist Economics represents an enlightened approach to our modern world infused with ancient wisdom, with benefits both personal and global, for generations to come.",en,9781632863669,"['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Buddhism', 'Business', 'Spirituality', 'Finance', 'Politics', 'Philosophy']",[],Hardcover,,224,Bloomsbury Press,February 21st 2017,,[],141,"['30', '48', '49', '10', '4']",90.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1481196210l/30038934.jpg,12,1,18.71

With Nero dead, the city holds its breath and awaits the arrival his successor, Servius Sulpicius Galba, governor of Hispania. The Empire prays for peace, but it prays in vain.

By the time he won the Nobel, Carducci had firmly established himself as one of the world's most well-known and influential literary figures with a large body of distinguished work and a long career of artistic achievement, political activism and religious agitation. He had published several volumes of poetry attracting worldwide critical acclaim... Carducci's credentials as a Satanist include not only his worldly successes and overt opposition to Christianity but his writing of the highly controversial poem, Inno a Satana or ""Hymn to Satan."" In writing, publicly reciting and twice publishing this astounding poem, he stepped firmly beyond his paganism and even his anti-clericalism into the realm of modern Satanism by embracing the mythic character of Satan as an exemplary role model and heroic archetypal symbol.

When Claire Barclay receives news that her beloved stepfather has had a stroke, she’s more than a little shaken. Leo is her last real relative, and his own children rarely check up on the old man. Claire and her husband, Art, leave New York and fly back to Scotland to care for him during the summer. Their visit makes clear that Leo is no longer capable of living on his own, but he is determined to stay in his beloved old house. Art comes up with the idea of turning the place into a conference center, thinking they could purchase the place from Leo and build him a cottage on the property. But the situation is much more complicated than it seems. Claire’s old flame, Jonas Fairwether, has become Leo’s caretaker and trusted confidant. Though Claire distrusts Jonas’s motives, Leo chooses to take his advice to put the house up for public auction rather than sell directly to Art and Claire. Claire is immediately suspicious, and even more so when she finds out that another application has been submitted to develop the property. Does Jonas Fairwether want to knock down the Leo’s house and build a development? It looks like whoever is behind the plan is being driven by financial gain, but there may be an even stronger motive.

17332243-hild,Hild,Light of the World #1,Nicola Griffith (Goodreads Author),3.77,"Hild is born into a world in transition. In seventh-century Britain, small kingdoms are merging, usually violently. A new religion is coming ashore; the old gods’ priests are worrying. Edwin of Northumbria plots to become overking of the Angles, ruthlessly using every tool at his disposal: blood, bribery, belief.Hild is the king’s youngest niece. She has the powerful curiosity of a bright child, a will of adamant, and a way of seeing the world—of studying nature, of matching cause with effect, of observing human nature and predicting what will happen next—that can seem uncanny, even supernatural, to those around her.

Imprisoned for some weeks in a wire cage open to the elements, Pound suffered a nervous collapse from the physical and emotional strain. Out of the agony of his own inferno came the eleven cantos that became the sixth book of his modernist epic, The Cantos, themselves conceived as a Divine Comedy for our time. The Pisan Cantos were published in 1948 by New Directions and in the following year were awarded the Bollingen Prize for poetry by the Library of Congress. The honor came amid violent controversy, for the dark cloud of treason still hung over Pound, incarcerated in St. Elizabeths Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Yet there is no doubt that The Pisan Cantos displays some of his finest and most affecting writing, marking an elegaic turn to the personal while synthesizing the philosophical and economic political themes of his previous cantos.

   explores the complexities of love and the human search for truth and meaning through the interconnected lives of several historical figures across four centuries--beginning with the astronomer Johannes Kepler, who discovered the laws of planetary motion, and ending with the marine biologist and author Rachel Carson, who catalyzed the environmental movement. 
Stretching between these figures is a cast of artists, writers, and scientists--mostly women, mostly queer--whose public contribution has risen out of their unclassifiable and often heartbreaking private relationships to change the way we understand, experience, and appreciate the universe. Among them are the astronomer Maria Mitchell, who paved the way for women in science; the sculptor Harriet Hosmer, who did the same in art; the journalist and literary critic Margaret Fuller, who sparked the feminist movement; and the poet Emily Dickinson.Emanating from these lives are larger questions about the measure of a good life and what it means to leave a lasting mark of betterment on an imperfect world: Are achievement and acclaim enough for happiness? Is genius? Is love? Weaving through the narrative is a set of peripheral figures--Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Darwin, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Walt Whitman--and a tapestry of themes spanning music, feminism, the history of science, the rise and decline of religion, and how the intersection of astronomy, poetry, and Transcendentalist philosophy fomented the environmental movement.",English,9781524748135,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Science', 'Essays', 'Biography', 'Feminism', 'LGBT', 'Poetry', 'Art']",[],Hardcover,,592,Pantheon Books,February 5th 2019,,[],1740,"['970', '492', '187', '67', '24']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1541193905l/40277347.jpg,10,1,18.06

T. B. Clore, Camp Douglas survivorThe Chicago doctors who inspected the prison in 1863 called Camp Douglas an “extermination camp.” It quickly became the largest Confederate burial ground outside of the South.What George Levy’s meticulous research, including newly discovered hospital records, has uncovered is not a pretty picture. The story of Camp Douglas is one of brutal guards, deliberate starvation of prisoners, neglect of the sick, sadistic torture, murder, corruption at all levels, and a beef scandal reaching into the White House.As a result of the overcrowding and substandard provisions, disease ran rampant and the mortality rate soared. By the thousands, prisoners needlessly died of pneumonia, smallpox, and other maladies. Most were buried in unmarked mass graves. The exact number of those who died is impossible to discern because of the Union's haphazard recordkeeping and general disregard for the deceased.Among the most shocking revelations are such forms of torture as hanging prisoners by their thumbs, hanging them by their heels and then whipping them, and forcing prisoners to sit with their exposed buttocks in the ice and snow.The Confederate Camp Andersonville never saw such gratuitous barbarity.",English,9781565543317,"['Civil War', 'History', 'American History', '19th Century', 'American Civil War', 'War', 'Historical']",[],Hardcover,,448,Pelican,January 31st 1999,March 1995,[],36,"['17', '10', '7', '2', '0']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347953264l/856619.jpg,10,1,19.44

The officers immediately opened fire, killing a number of protestors and wounding some two hundred others. Albert Parsons was the best-known of those hanged; Haymarket is his story. Parsons, humanist and autodidact, was an ex-Confederate soldier who grew up in Texas in the 1870s, and fell in love with Lucy Gonzalez, a vibrant, outspoken black woman who preferred to describe herself as of Spanish and Creole descent. The novel tells the story of their lives together, of their growing political involvement, of the formation of a colorful circle of ""co-conspirators""-immigrants, radical intellectuals, journalists, advocates of the working class-and of the events culminating in bloodshed. More than just a moving story of love and human struggle, more than a faithful account of a watershed event in United States history, Haymarket presents a layered and dynamic revelation of late nineteenth-century Chicago, and of the lives of a handful of remarkable individuals who were willing to risk their lives for the promise of social change.",English,9781583226186,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Politics', 'American']",[],Hardcover,,336,Seven Stories Press,February 3rd 2004,February 1st 2003,[],107,"['19', '44', '34', '9', '1']",91.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320484828l/1607657.jpg,9,1,4.46

Beautiful but shy Judy Melton, daughter of a naval war hero, her determinedly feckless friend, the social butterfly Meggie Gore-Stewart, seemingly demure Mathilda Eastcott, and Corrie Hogarth, the tomboy daughter of the owner of the local boatyard, are all in their very individual ways determined to play an active part in the defence of their country. Knitting socks and bomb-dodging is not what they have in mind for themselves while their husbands and brothers, fathers and lovers are away fighting.But attitudes to women's roles in a warring world are difficult to change, and at first all four find it impossible to settle for the traditional kind of work that their families envisage. However, it is not just the young women of Bexham who are determined to find new roles for themselves - so are their mothers. In this manner the little Sussex village, facing as it does the coastline of Nazi-invaded France, finds its closely sewn social fabric gradually unstitch, inch by little inch.Under the tree on the green the women of Bexham meet to look back on a landscape that has changed irrevocably, and which they have in their own ways helped to alter. None of them are the same, and yet, with the men returning from war, they are expected to slip back into their simple roles of mother, daughter, grandmother. This, more than anything perhaps, is their greatest sacrifice. Having been freed by war, they have now to relinquish that very independence that gave them the liberty for which they once fought.Only the chestnut tree planted by Corrie at the edge of the village flourishes in the accepted manner, finally becoming the uniting symbol of all that has passed forever.",English,9780553812770,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'World War II', 'Romance', 'War', 'Historical Romance', 'Novels']",[],Mass Market Paperback,,464,Bantam,April 22nd 2003,2002,[],269,"['62', '92', '79', '32', '4']",87.0,"['Sussex, England (United Kingdom)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1354124633l/3563022.jpg,9,1,3.11

Simpson case that no one else has dared to write, that no one else could write. In Outrage, the famed prosecutor of Charles Manson and bestselling author of Helter Skelter goes to the heart of the trial that divided the country and made a mockery of justice.  Vincent Bugliosi, who never lost a murder case, brilliantly outlines the five reasons why O.J. Simpson got away with murder: the worst possible jury, a sloppy and incomplete prosecution, a fatal change of venue, judicial error that allowed the defense to play the race card, and a weak summation and rebuttal that barely addressed the defense's frame-up and conspiracy theories. He reveals:--The offer Marcia Clark and Bill Hodgman should never have refused.--The bluff that saved the defense's cardboard case.--What Deputy Sheriff Jeff Stuart overheard when Rosey Grier visited Simpson in jail.--The 17 words Johnnie Cochran used to cover his argument that could have been his undoing if caught. --Why the jurors never heard Simpson's first police interview-- filled with self-incriminating statements that alone could have convicted him of murder.1.  What mistake in jury selection could have cost Marcia Clark the trial--even before she argued the case?2. What did Simpson do to make sure the gloves wouldn't fit?3. How did Judge Ito's behavior towards Marcia Clark prejudice the jury?4. Why did the prosecutors suppress Simpson's ""smoking gun""?5.

Montgomery,3.68,"A sweet and moving romance from the author of the beloved Anne of Green Gables series!Eric Marshall, recent college graduate, has the world at his feet. He’s handsome, popular, wealthy, and surprisingly, single. Living the bachelor lifestyle with his widowed father, he’s never given much thought to romance. When an old school friend asks Eric to substitute teach for him on Prince Edward Island while he recuperates from an illness, Eric thinks, why not? He’s got some time to kill before diving into the family business with his father, and the rustic island may be a good diversion for him.Eric falls into the easy routine of island life, and his status as eligible bachelor endears him to the locals. Eric is still not thinking of romance, but he’s about to find it in a most unexpected place…Kilmeny Gordon is sweet and smart and beautiful, perfect in every way but one: she can’t speak. She’s been sheltered all her life due to her disability and the scandal surrounding her birth. She wiles away her hours helping her aunt and uncle on the farm and playing her violin in her favorite secluded spot. When Eric stumbles into her hidden orchard, he brings a whole new world with him, and a friendship that both frightens her and thrills her. As the summer days grow longer and their friendship blossoms, sweet, silent Kilmeny, with her sunny enthusiasm and haunting music, manages to do what neither the co-eds of Queenslea College nor the village lasses of Lindsay have been able to do—capture Eric’s heart.But Kilmeny knows he’ll soon have to go back to his life on the mainland, a world of business meetings and parties and prejudicial people—a world in which she’ll hold him back and never fit in. None of that matters to Eric, but how can he get her to accept that she’s the only woman he’ll ever love, when she is convinced that the only way to love him is to let him go?Bonus Content: Introduction and IllustrationsLegacy Vintage Collection Enhanced eBooks have been professionally edited and professionally formatted for your favorite e-reader!

During his more than forty years in the business, Williams has been one of the true innovators, winning three Academy Awards and serving as the link between Disney's golden age of animation by hand and the new computer animation exemplified by Toy Story. Perhaps even more important, though, has been his dedication in passing along his knowledge to a new generation of animators so that they in turn could push the medium in new directions. In this book, based on his sold-out master classes in the United States and across Europe, Williams provides the underlying principles of animation that every animator--from beginner to expert, classic animator to computer animation whiz --needs.

Robert Fisk's explosive Pity the Nation recounts Sharon and Arafat's first deadly encounter in Lebanon in the early 1980s and explains why the Israel–Palestine relationship seems so intractable. A remarkable combination of war reporting and analysis by an author who has witnessed the carnage of Beirut for twenty-five years, Fisk, the first journalist to whom bin Laden announced his jihad against the U.S., is one of the world's most fearless and honored foreign correspondents. He spares no one in this saga of the civil war and subsequent Israeli invasion: the PLO, whose thuggish behavior alienated most Lebanese; the various Lebanese factions, whose appalling brutality spared no one; the Syrians, who supported first the Christians and then the Muslims in their attempt to control Lebanon; and the Israelis, who tried to install their own puppets and, with their 1982 invasion, committed massive war crimes of their own. It includes a moving finale that recounts the travails of Fisk's friend Terry Anderson who was kidnapped by Hezbollah and spent 2,454 days in captivity. Fully updated to include the Israeli withdrawl from south Lebanon and Ariel Sharon's electoral victory over Ehud Barak, this edition has sixty pages of new material and a new preface.

Despite his renown, however, there are few comprehensive collections of his verse available and even fewer translated editions.Translators E. H. and A. M. Blackmore have collected Victor Hugo's essential verse into a single, bilingual volume that showcases all the facets of Hugo's oeuvre, including intimate love poems, satires against the political establishment, serene meditations, religious verse, and narrative poems illustrating his mastery of the art of storytelling and his abiding concern for the social issues of his time. More than half of this volume's eight thousand lines of verse appear here for the first time in English, providing readers with a new perspective on each of the fascinating periods of Hugo's career and aspects of his style. Introductions to each section guide the reader through the stages of Hugo's writing, while notes on individual poems provide information not found in even the most detailed French-language editions.Illustrated with Hugo's own paintings and drawings, this lucid translation—available on the eve of Hugo's bicentenary—pays homage to this towering figure of nineteenth-century literature by capturing the energy of his poetry, the drama and satirical force of his language, and the visionary beauty of his writing as a whole.",English,9780226359816,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'France', 'French Literature', 'Reference', 'Fiction', 'European Literature', 'Literature']",[],Paperback,,664,University of Chicago Press,June 1st 2004,January 1st 1949,['ALTA National Translation Award (2002)'],281,"['116', '106', '47', '10', '2']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328873542l/108347.jpg,8,1,23.28

585024.The_Soundscape,The Soundscape: Our Environment and the Tuning of the World,,R. Murray Schafer,4.11,"The soundscape--a term coined by the author--is our sonic environment, the ever-present array of noises with which we all live. Beginning with the primordial sounds of nature, we have experienced an ever-increasing complexity of our sonic surroundings. As civilization develops, new noises rise up around us: from the creaking wheel, the clang of the blacksmith’s hammer, and the distant chugging of steam trains to the “sound imperialism” of airports, city streets, and factories. The author contends that we now suffer from an overabundance of acoustic information and a proportionate diminishing of our ability to hear the nuances and subtleties of sound. Our task, he maintains, is to listen, analyze, and make distinctions. As a society we have become more aware of the toxic wastes that can enter our bodies through the air we breathe and the water we drink. In fact, the pollution of our sonic environment is no less real. Schafer emphasizes the importance of discerning the sounds that enrich and feed us and using them to create healthier environments. To this end, he explains how to classify sounds, appreciating their beauty or ugliness, and provides exercises and “soundwalks” to help us become more discriminating and sensitive to the sounds around us. This book is a pioneering exploration of our acoustic environment, past and present, and an attempt to imagine what it might become in the future.",English,9780892814558,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'History', 'Art', 'Nature', 'Theory', 'Film', 'Canada']",[],Paperback,,320,Destiny Books,October 1st 1993,January 1st 1977,[],544,"['222', '194', '100', '20', '8']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388338669l/585024.jpg,8,1,15.32

Volume 14 (of 27) by AL CAPP (Softcover) The most popular of Capp's hundreds of distinctive characters was the Shmoo. This lovable little creature loved mankind so much that it would sacrifice itself and turn into a ham steak, a gallon of milk or a dozen eggs: whatever its owner desired. Its whiskers made nice toothpicks and its eyes could be recycled as buttons. Most important, a Shmoo could reproduce faster than a rabbit. Thus, if you had one Shmoo, you were set. You didn't need to work at all. Thus did the apparent book for mankind become its curse and the powers that be decreed that all Shmoos must be exterminated. Capp's insightful morality tale was so popular that it spawned an unprecedented merchandising bonanza. Two introductions, by David Schreiner and by science fiction writer Harlan Ellison, are illustrated with various Shmoo toys manufactured. The large back cover photograph shows a selection of Shmoo merchandise in color from the Denis Kitchen collection.

And it's a story that's been believed ever since. Too bad it just isn't true.Jonathan Lopez has done what no other writer could--tracking down primary sources in four countries and five languages to tell for the first time the real story of the world's most famous forger. Neither unappreciated artist nor antifascist hero, Van Meegeren emerges in The Man Who Made Vermeers as an ingenious, dyed-in-the-wool crook--a talented Mr. Ripley armed with a paintbrush, who worked virtually his entire adult life making and selling fake Old Masters. Drawing upon extensive interviews with descendents of Van Meegeren's partners in crime, Lopez also explores the networks of illicit commerce that operated across Europe between the wars. Not only was Van Meegeren a key player in that high-stakes game during the 1920s, landing fakes with powerful dealers and famous collectors such as Andrew Mellon (including two pseudo-Vermeers that Mellon donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.), but the forger and his associates later offered a case study in wartime opportunism as they cashed in on the Nazi occupation.The Man Who Made Vermeers is a long-overdue unvarnishing of Van Meegeren's legend and a deliciously detailed story of deceit in the art world.",English,9780151013418,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Art History', 'Biography', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'World War II', 'Biography Memoir']","['Han van Meegeren', 'Johannes Vermeer', 'Hermann Göring', 'Joseph Duveen']",Hardcover,,340,"Harcourt, Inc.",September 8th 2008,July 28th 2008,"['Edgar Award Nominee for Best Fact Crime (2009)', 'Marfield Prize (National Award for Arts Writing) Nominee (2008)']",8359,"['3058', '2071', '1921', '820', '489']",84.0,['Netherlands'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328834298l/3359595.jpg,7,1,5.47

147537.Franklin_and_Winston,Franklin and Winston: An Intimate Portrait of an Epic Friendship,,Jon Meacham,4.11,"Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill were the greatest leaders of ""the Greatest Generation."" In Franklin and Winston, Jon Meacham explores the fascinating relationship between the two men who piloted the free world to victory in World War II. It was a crucial friendship, and a unique one--a president and a prime minister spending enormous amounts of time together (113 days during the war) and exchanging nearly two thousand messages. Amid cocktails, cigarettes, and cigars, they met, often secretly, in places as far-flung as Washington, Hyde Park, Casablanca, and Teheran, talking to each other of war, politics, the burden of command, their health, their wives, and their children.Born in the nineteenth century and molders of the twentieth and twenty-first, Roosevelt and Churchill had much in common. Sons of the elite, students of history, politicians of the first rank, they savored power. In their own time both men were underestimated, dismissed as arrogant, and faced skeptics and haters in their own nations--yet both magnificently rose to the central challenges of the twentieth century. Theirs was a kind of love story, with an emotional Churchill courting an elusive Roosevelt. The British prime minister, who rallied his nation in its darkest hour, standing alone against Adolf Hitler, was always somewhat insecure about his place in FDR's affections--which was the way Roosevelt wanted it. A man of secrets, FDR liked to keep people off balance, including his wife, Eleanor, his White House aides--and Winston Churchill.Confronting tyranny and terror, Roosevelt and Churchill built a victorious alliance amid cataclysmic events and occasionally conflicting interests. Franklin and Winston is also the story of their marriages and their families, two clans caught up in the most sweeping global conflict in history.Meacham's new sources--including unpublished letters of FDR's great secret love, Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd, the papers of Pamela Churchill Harriman, and interviews with the few surviving people who were in FDR and Churchill's joint company--shed fresh light on the characters of both men as he engagingly chronicles the hours in which they decided the course of the struggle.Hitler brought them together; later in the war, they drifted apart, but even in the autumn of their alliance, the pull of affection was always there. Charting the personal drama behind the discussions of strategy and statecraft, Meacham has written the definitive account of the most remarkable friendship of the modern age.",English,9780812972825,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Presidents', 'World War II', 'Politics', 'American History', 'War', 'Historical', 'Biography Memoir']","['Franklin D.

Perhaps because it does not involve conforming to a specific lifestyle, the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin has attracted millions of adherents around the world during recent years. Its message is simply that those who commit themselves in faith, study and practice will achieve their goals and be moved to dedicate themselves to the wider cause of human happiness, world peace and environmental harmony.In this comprehensive and helpful book, the late Richard Causton, chairman of the lay society of those who practise the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin in the UK, explains the teachings and practice of the movement.

John Sutherland is perfectly suited to the task. He has researched, taught, and written on virtually every area of literature, and his infectious passion for books and reading has defined his own life. Now he guides young readers and the grown-ups in their lives on an entertaining journey 'through the wardrobe' to a greater awareness of how literature from across the world can transport us and help us to make sense of what it means to be human. Sutherland introduces great classics in his own irresistible way, enlivening his offerings with humor as well as learning: Beowulf, Shakespeare, Don Quixote, the Romantics, Dickens, Moby Dick, The Waste Land, Woolf, 1984, and dozens of others. He adds to these a less-expected, personal selection of authors and works, including literature usually considered well below 'serious attention' - from the rude jests of Anglo-Saxon runes to The Da Vinci Code. With masterful digressions into various themes - censorship, narrative tricks, self-publishing, taste, creativity, and madness - Sutherland demonstrates the full depth and intrigue of reading. For younger readers, he offers a proper introduction to literature, promising to interest as much as instruct. For more experienced readers, he promises just the same.",English,9780300186857,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Literature', 'Books About Books', 'Literary Criticism', 'Reference', 'Writing', 'Historical', 'Language', 'English Literature']",[],Hardcover,,288,Yale University Press,November 5th 2013,,[],1277,"['355', '544', '290', '72', '16']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366555209l/17802957.jpg,7,1,6.69

33834730-the-unquiet-grave,The Unquiet Grave,Ballad #12,Sharyn McCrumb (Goodreads Author),3.71,"From New York Times bestselling author Sharyn McCrumb comes a finely wrought novel set in nineteenth-century West Virginia, based on the true story of one of the strangest murder trials in American history—the case of the Greenbrier Ghost.Lakin, West Virginia, 1930 Following a suicide attempt and consigned to a segregated insane asylum, attorney James P. D. Gardner finds himself under the care of Dr. James Boozer. Fresh out of medical school, Dr. Boozer is eager to try the new talking cure for insanity, and encourages his elderly patient to reminisce about his experiences as the first black attorney to practice law in nineteenth-century West Virginia. Gardner's most memorable case was the one in which he helped to defend a white man on trial for the murder of his young bride—a case that the prosecution based on the testimony of a ghost.  Greenbrier, West Virginia, 1897 Beautiful, willful Zona Heaster has always lived in the mountains of West Virginia. Despite her mother’s misgivings, Zona marries Erasmus Trout Shue, the handsome blacksmith who has recently come to Greenbrier County. After weeks of silence from the newlyweds, riders come to the Heasters’ place to tell them that Zona has died from a fall, attributed to a recent illness. Mary Jane is determined to get justice for her daughter. A month after the funeral, she informs the county prosecutor that Zona’s ghost appeared to her, saying that she had been murdered. An autopsy, ordered by the reluctant prosecutor, confirms her claim.  The Greenbrier Ghost is renowned in American folklore, but Sharyn McCrumb is the first author to look beneath the legend to unearth the facts. Using a century of genealogical material and other historical documents, McCrumb reveals new information about the story and brings to life the personalities in the trial: the prosecutor, a former Confederate cavalryman; the defense attorney, a pro-Union bridgeburner, who nevertheless had owned slaves; and the mother of the murdered woman, who doggedly sticks to her ghost story—all seen through the eyes of a young black lawyer on the cusp of a new century, with his own tragedies yet to come.  With its unique blend of masterful research and mesmerizing folklore, illuminating the story’s fascinating and complex characters, The Unquiet Grave confirms Sharyn McCrumb’s place among the finest Southern writers at work today.",English,9781476772875,"['Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'True Crime', 'Horror', 'Crime', 'Historical Mystery', 'Ghosts', 'Ghost Stories']",[],Kindle Edition,,369,Atria Books,September 12th 2017,,[],2154,"['424', '882', '679', '139', '30']",92.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1487139683l/33834730.jpg,7,1,5.39

Unscathed from glory at Waterloo, Gervase expected a hero's welcome - instead he's given a frigid cold shoulder. Upon his return only Theo, a cousin even quieter than himself, is there to greet him--and when he meets his stepmother and half-brother open disdain put a chill on Gervase's welcome, and he detects open regret that he has survived inconveniently two wars. Now he must establish himself as the new head of the house... and ignore his family's rising hostility. Then Gervase's eye is caught by beautiful and charming Mariann Bolderwood, a collector of beaux -- the same young woman already much in favor with his half-brother. Gervase struggles to maintain a gentlemanly balance, but now the brothers are again rivals as they bid for the lady's attentions.

177539.The_History_of_Jazz,The History of Jazz,,Ted Gioia,4.06,"Jazz is the most colorful and varied art form in the world and it was born in one of the most colorful and varied cities, New Orleans. From the seed first planted by slave dances held in Congo Square and nurtured by early ensembles led by Buddy Belden and Joe ""King"" Oliver, jazz began its long winding odyssey across America and around the world, giving flower to a thousand different forms--swing, bebop, cool jazz, jazz-rock fusion--and a thousand great musicians. Now, in The History of Jazz, Ted Gioia tells the story of this music as it has never been told before, in a book that brilliantly portrays the legendary jazz players, the breakthrough styles, and the world in which it evolved. Here are the giants of jazz and the great moments of jazz history--Jelly Roll Morton (""the world's greatest hot tune writer""), Louis Armstrong (whose O-keh recordings of the mid-1920s still stand as the most significant body of work that jazz has produced), Duke Ellington at the Cotton Club, cool jazz greats such as Gerry Mulligan, Stan Getz, and Lester Young, Charlie Parker's surgical precision of attack, Miles Davis's 1955 performance at the Newport Jazz Festival, Ornette Coleman's experiments with atonality, Pat Metheny's visionary extension of jazz-rock fusion, the contemporary sounds of Wynton Marsalis, and the post-modernists of the Knitting Factory. Gioia provides the reader with lively portraits of these and many other great musicians, intertwined with vibrant commentary on the music they created. Gioia also evokes the many worlds of jazz, taking the reader to the swamp lands of the Mississippi Delta, the bawdy houses of New Orleans, the rent parties of Harlem, the speakeasies of Chicago during the Jazz Age, the after hours spots of corrupt Kansas city, the Cotton Club, the Savoy, and the other locales where the history of jazz was made. And as he traces the spread of this protean form, Gioia provides much insight into the social context in which the music was born. He shows for instance how the development of technology helped promote the growth of jazz--how ragtime blossomed hand-in-hand with the spread of parlor and player pianos, and how jazz rode the growing popularity of the record industry in the 1920s. We also discover how bebop grew out of the racial unrest of the 1940s and '50s, when black players, no longer content with being ""entertainers,"" wanted to be recognized as practitioners of a serious musical form. Jazz is a chameleon art, delighting us with the ease and rapidity with which it changes colors. Now, in Ted Gioia's The History of Jazz, we have at last a book that captures all these colors on one glorious palate. Knowledgeable, vibrant, and comprehensive, it is among the small group of books that can truly be called classics of jazz literature.",English,9780195126532,"['Music', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Jazz', 'Art', 'Cultural', 'Reference', 'Criticism', 'American History', 'The United States Of America']",[],Paperback,,471,Oxford University Press,May 6th 1998,November 1st 1997,[],3770,"['1511', '1347', '634', '169', '109']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348549243l/177539.jpg,7,1,5.20

955496.The_Dance_of_Death,The Dance of Death,,Hans Holbein,4.31,"Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543), remembered today for his insightful portraits, was better known in his own time for his varied and extensive graphic works, the most celebrated of which was The Dance of Death. This work, from the woodblocks of collaborator Hans Lützelburger, was first published in book form in 1538.The theme of the dance of death was a popular one of the sixteenth century. Holbein captured the feeling of death, the leveler, in its attack on all classes, both sexes, and all ages. A stylized skeleton seizes the child from his mother's breast. The skeleton snatches, plays, tugs, and cavorts throughout the rest of the book. The king, emperor, pope, and cardinal must cease from their functions. The skull is thrust into the face of the astrologer. The hourglass runs out onto the floor. Countess, nun, sailor, peddler, senator are all stopped by the common force. Forty-one finely cut, highly detailed woodcuts capture the single motif, Memento mori: ""Remember, you will die."" Although the theme is common, the variety of expressions, social groups, backgrounds, styles of dress and architecture, and calls to death are so varied that each one is unique in its power.This edition, reprinting the unabridged 1538 edition, is the first in a series reprinting great rare books from the Rosenwald Collection. Besides the woodcuts, the book contains a prefatory letter by Jean de Vauzéle and various quotations, depictions, and meditations on death, deaths of men, and the necessity of death. A repeated series of the 41 woodblocks follows the reprinted work and contains English translations of the quotations and verses. Art historians and social historians will find this to be one of the best depictions of class life caught at its fateful moment. The collector will find this to be the finest reproduction of one of Holbein's major works.",English,9780486228044,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classics', 'Art History', 'Art and Photography', 'Horror', 'European History']",[],Paperback,,160,Dover Publications,June 1st 1971,1538,[],201,"['93', '82', '22', '3', '1']",98.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415677873l/955496.jpg,7,1,9.03

They traveled from Newfoundland to Florida, deep into the heart of Mexico, through the Southwest, the Pacific Northwest, and into Alaska's Pribilof Islands. Two years later, Wild America, their classic account of the trip, was published.On the eve of that book's fiftieth anniversary, naturalist Scott Weidensaul retraces Peterson and Fisher's steps to tell the story of wild America today. How has the continent's natural landscape changed over the past fifty years? How have the wildlife, the rivers, and the rugged, untouched terrain fared? The journey takes Weidensaul to the coastal communities of Newfoundland, where he examines the devastating impact of the Atlantic cod fishery's collapse on the ecosystem; to Florida, where he charts the virtual extinction of the great wading bird colonies that Peterson and Fisher once documented; to the Mexican tropics of Xilitla, which have become a growing center of ecotourism since Fisher and Peterson's exposition. And perhaps most surprising of all, Weidensaul finds that much of what Peterson and Fisher discovered remains untouched by the industrial developments of the last fifty years.

83491.Flashbacks,Flashbacks,,Timothy Leary,4.09,"With a foreword by William Burroughs, this frenetic autobiography relates the life story of Timothy Leary, one of the key figures of the1960s North American counterculture, and the primary proponent of psychedelia as a way of life. Leary’s controversial views made him a public enemy in the United States, where he was eventually arrested in 1970 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. His escape from prison, and subsequent flight, with the help of the Weathermen, first to Algeria, then to Switzerland, Vienna, Beirut, and finally Kabul, Afghanistan, read like something out of a novel. Other events in Leary’s life were no less dramatic, and he chronicles them in this book openly and energetically. Intriguing cameos of iconic figures are woven into the author’s life history, including one by Cary Grant, whose experiments with lysergic acid are described in detail. Ultimately, Timothy Leary’s memories are as much a record of a singular era in American history as they are one man’s recollections of a struggle against persecution and being ostracized.",English,9780874778700,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Science']",[],Paperback,,407,Tarcher,March 17th 1997,1983,[],654,"['263', '235', '122', '22', '12']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171046059l/83491.jpg,6,1,16.30
254395.Just_Checking,Just Checking: Scenes From the Life of an Obsessive-Compulsive,,Emily Colas,3.54,"We all worry. We all have moments of unfounded dread (Is someone behind that door?), or little phobias (roaches) or superstitions (step on a crack) that we indulge. Just Checking is an autobiographical account of what it is like to live with a full-blown case of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which, at its height, finds author Emily Colas nervous that she will contract a disease from blood that she sees on television. In the course of the book, what at first appear to her husband and friends to be Colas's idiosyncratic notions accumulate until she is frozen by the astounding psychological binds of OCD. Using precise (of course), connect-the-dots scenes, Colas draws a life that is at first highly monitored and ultimately unraveled by her disorder. One imagines that from afar, Colas's behavior at the height of her illness would look incomprehensible and just plain weird: She has to check the dishwasher multiple times before using it to make sure the cat is safe; the packaging of every new toothbrush has to meet rigorous sanitary standards; the landlord can't attempt to find new tenants for her apartment  she won't let them in the house. But readers are not at a distance here. Instead, we become privy to Colas's somewhat apologetic but firm explanations of what her logic was, and what it felt like to be afraid. She is so honest and witty that one can't help liking her, rooting for her, and wishing help would come. In a typical vignette, when the family tries to go to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (""definitely a mistake""), Colas is terrified that shewillstep on blood: When I was a kid in New York, all we had to eat on the street were pretzels and hot dogs. Food that was readily identifiable. Now, vendors sell the fanciest things with cherries, berries, jelly, and other crap that's way too close to the color of blood. We finally made it to where we had to go, but not before I had inspected the bottom of my shoes. There was a mushy red object there. Maybe a cherry, possibly a finger. The kids watched the parade on TV and I had a nice new worry. My kids don't even remember that lovely November day, but, lucky for me, I do. This event is sad and resonant, but it also manages to be viscerally entertaining. The result is that instead of inspiring schadenfreude, this book reminds us that psychological disorders are often exaggerations of the ordinary and familiar. We all, on a continuum, wish to survive, to avoid disease, to impose order on our lives. We sympathize with Colas's desperate attempts to find safety and with her seemingly loving husband's gradual loss of tolerance. Even the not-so-funny poems that are occasionally interspersed among the perfectly crafted chapterettes find their place. Strange as it may be to find charm in a memoir of illness, Colas is utterly winning.

219557.The_Pushcart_War,The Pushcart War,,"Jean Merrill, Ronni Solbert (Illustrator)",4.16,"DO YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE PUSHCART WAR? THE REAL HISTORY? It’s a story of how regular people banded together and, armed with little more than their brains and good aim, defeated a mighty foe.Not long ago the streets of New York City were smelly, smoggy, sooty, and loud. There were so many trucks making deliveries that it might take an hour for a car to travel a few blocks. People blamed the truck owners and the truck owners blamed the little wooden pushcarts that traveled the city selling everything from flowers to hot dogs. Behind closed doors the truck owners declared war on the pushcart peddlers. Carts were smashed from Chinatown to Chelsea. The peddlers didn’t have money or the mayor on their side, but that didn’t stop them from fighting back. They used pea shooters to blow tacks into the tires of trucks, they outwitted the police, and they marched right up to the grilles of those giant trucks and dared them to drive down their streets. Today, thanks to the ingenuity of the pushcart peddlers, the streets belong to the people—and to the pushcarts.The Pushcart War was first published more than fifty years ago. It has inspired generations of children and been adapted for television, radio, and the stage around the world. It was included on School Library Journal’s list of One Hundred Books That Shaped the Twentieth Century, and its assertion that a committed group of men and women can prevail against a powerful force is as relevant in the twenty-first century as it was in 1964.",English,9780440471479,"['Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Young Adult', 'Historical Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Humor', 'Classics', 'New York', 'Juvenile', 'Chapter Books']",[],Paperback,,224,Dell Yearling,May 1st 1987,1964,"['Lewis Carroll Shelf Award', ""Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award Nominee (1966)""]",4124,"['1810', '1427', '689', '145', '53']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320559465l/219557.jpg,6,1,3.87

469778.Overtreated,Overtreated: Why Too Much Medicine Is Making Us Sicker and Poorer,,Shannon Brownlee,4.02,"Though touted as perhaps the best in the world, the American medical system is filled with hypocrisies. Our health care is staggeringly expensive, yet one in six Americans has no health insurance. We have some of the most skilled physicians in the world, yet one hundred thousand patients die each year from medical errors. In this gripping, eye-opening book, award-winning journalist Shannon Brownlee takes readers inside the hospital to dismantle some of our most venerated myths about American medicine. Using vivid examples of real patients and physicians, Overtreated debunks the idea that most of medicine is based in sound science, and shows how our health care system delivers huge amounts of unnecessary care that is not only expensive and wasteful but can actually imperil the health of patients.The interests of politicians and the medical-industrial complex continually trump those of patients, seducing the wealthy with unnecessary procedures and leaving the poor with haphazard access to treatment. Backward economic incentives allow patients with chronic conditions to receive ineffective care, and roll after roll of red tape undermines even the best-intentioned doctors. Tens of thousands of patients die each year from overtreatment. American medicine is in desperate need of fixing.Nevertheless, Overtreated ultimately conveys a message of hope by reframing the debate over health care reform. Americans worry about rationing--that any effort to rein in the high cost of health care will result in limited access to life-saving treatments. Covering the uninsured seems like an insurmountable problem because it will drive up costs even more. Overtreated offers a way to control costs and cover the uninsured, while simultaneously improving the quality of American medicine. Shannon Brownlee's humane, intelligent, and penetrating analysis empowers readers to avoid the perils of overtreatment, as well as pointing the way to better health care for everyone.",English,9781582345802,"['Nonfiction', 'Health', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Health Care', 'Science', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'History', 'Social Issues']",[],Hardcover,,343,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,September 18th 2007,,[],908,"['322', '351', '180', '40', '15']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431397952l/469778.jpg,6,1,5.20

When she takes up with a cocksure new companion, Agostino, feeling ignored and unloved, begins hanging around with a group of local young toughs. Though repelled by their squalor and brutality, and repeatedly humiliated for his weakness and ignorance when it comes to women and sex, the boy is increasingly, masochistically drawn to the gang and its rough games. He finds himself unable to make sense of his troubled feelings. Hoping to be full of manly calm, he is instead beset by guilty curiosity and an urgent desire to sever, at any cost, the thread of troubled sensuality that binds him to his mother.

239843.The_Ship_of_Fools,The Ship of Fools,,"Sebastian Brant, Edwin H. Zeydel (Translator)",3.85,"Published in 1494 in Basel, The Ship of Fools was soon translated into every major European language. It provoked a vast number of imitations and remained steadily in print through the eighteenth century (with sporadic reprints after that). It still possesses an enormous vigor and vitality.The book owes its long life to an imagination, wit, and humor rich with insights into human nature, yet neither bitter nor namby pamby. Its commentary on the boasting, pedantry, false learning, gambling, gluttony, medical folly, adultery, greed, envy, hatred, pride and other failings that mark humanity are sharp and telling, and, sadly, as relevant today as they were 450 years ago.This translation by Professor Edwin H. Zeydel is the only accurate English translation ever published. (Barclay's version is really a pastiche written in imitation of Brant.) The form Professor Zeydel uses is verse, like the original, and he even retains the original rhyme scheme and meter. The achievement is remarkable, for it captures all the charm and movement of the original German while sacrificing nothing to readability and fluidity.Published now with the 114 original Renaissance woodcuts and with Professor Zeydel's annotations, a biography of Brant, a publishing history, and a survey of the work's influence, this will unquestionably remain the definitive edition of The Ship of Fools in English.

The second chapter walks through the way what we see determines our thoughts, and demonstrates the counterintuitive point that believing is in fact seeing. The third chapter takes a leap beyond cutting edge science to audaciously set out a general theory of beauty, explaining why, the world over, cultures have fundamentally similar notions of what is attractive. The fourth chapter explores the bizarre world of synesthetes, people who see colors in numbers, textures in smells, sounds in sights, and flavors in sounds. Finally, V. S.

145249.Beyond_the_Sky_and_the_Earth,Beyond the Sky and the Earth: A Journey Into Bhutan,,Jamie Zeppa,4.16,"At age 24 Jamie Zeppa, a Canadian who had never been outside of North America, said goodbye to her fiancé and her plans for graduate school and moved to Bhutan, a remote Buddhist kingdom in the Himalayas. Beyond the Sky and the Earth is an autobiographical work that details her experiences and transformations after spending three years in Bhutan. It is as much a book about Zeppa's day-to-day life in Bhutan as it is about the personal awakenings and realizations that she had while living there. Visitors to Bhutan, an increasingly hot tourist destination, are still few and far between, largely because of tight government restrictions on entry, visa requirements, and a law requiring tourists to spend at least $200 a day there. There aren't many books on Bhutan, and even fewer first-hand accounts of life there. Beyond the Sky and the Earth stands out as both an informative introduction to the people and culture of Bhutan and as a beautiful piece of travel literature set against the backdrop of one of the most remote and unspoiled places on earth. Zeppa recounts her experiences living abroad, such as learning to live without electricity and carrying on a forbidden affair with one of her students, in such a compelling way that even someone who has never left home will become entranced by her story and captivated by her unique experiences. Naturally, Zeppa experienced culture shock when she arrived in Bhutan. The hardships she encountered seemed insurmountable, and at first she thought she couldn't bear it and fantasized about returning to Canada. She had to learn a new language in order to communicate with her students, she had to learn to live on her own, and she had to learn to deal with homesickness. Perhaps her biggest challenge was learning how to reconcile her growing love for Bhutan with her nostalgia for her life in Canada, her family, and her fiancé. But after living among Bhutan's Himalayan peaks, lush valleys, colorful villages, and friendly people, and after gaining an appreciation for life in a place frozen in time, Zeppa realizes that she feels at home in Bhutan and wants to stay.Although to Zeppa Bhutan is a magical land, she cautions herself and the reader not to deem it ""the last Shangri-La,"" as is often done by the lucky travelers who make their way through the red tape required for entry into the kingdom. Bhutan is not without its problems: it is an underdeveloped country plagued by the problems that affect many places cut off from modernity. There is infant mortality, illness, and poverty. There are also domestic and international tensions that stem from the government's stringent regulations intended to preserve the national culture. Among them are the prohibition of foreign television and a requirement that people wear the national dress, a kira for women and a gho for men.Few of us will ever get to see the place that was Zeppa's home. But her narrative is so clear and insightful that you easily feel as though you are sharing this portion of her life with her. Even if you haven't had the experience of living abroad, or if the prospect of a trip to the furthest reaches of Asia is not in your cards, Zeppa's book is a worthy read on many levels. From her powerful use of language to describe the superb beauty of Bhutan's landscape to her passionate description of her spellbinding relationship with her future husband, Beyond the Sky and the Earth draws readers in and takes them on her rocky ride to self-realization. When trying to explain to a friend what she finds appealing about Bhutan, Zeppa writes: ""It takes a long time to find the true words, to put them in order, to tell the whole story. It is not just this or that, the mountains, the people, it is me and the way I can be here, the freedom to walk unafraid into the great dark night. It is a hundred thousand things and I could never trace or tell all the connections and reflections, the shadows and echoes and secret relations between them.""But, in fact, Zeppa does tell the reader about these connections and reflections in a lyrical way. After reading the book, you will have a deep understanding, appreciation, and respect for Zeppa's strength of character and for the wonders of Bhutan.Beyond the Sky and the Earth is a delight to read in every way. Zeppa's beautiful prose, peppered alternately with funny observations and profound soul-searching, is a truly special and unique work that will leave you craving an adventure of your own.",English,9781573228152,"['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Asia', 'Biography', 'Adventure', 'Biography Memoir', 'Cultural', 'Autobiography', 'Canada']",[],Paperback,,303,Riverhead Books,May 1st 2000,May 18th 1999,[],3440,"['1396', '1370', '529', '105', '40']",96.0,['Bhutan'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309283944l/145249.jpg,5,1,5.20

209936.Fauvism,Fauvism,,Sarah Whitfield (Goodreads Author) (著),3.65,"Les Fauves (the wild beasts) was the nickname given in 1905 to a group of painters led by Henri Matisse. Today, their paintings are among the most popular of all twentieth-century art. Yet when Matisse and his friends - Derain, Vlaminck, Marquet, Dufy and Braque among them - first exhibited their work, the reaction of public and critics was astonishment and often hostility. Using strong, even strident, colors, applied in a manner deriving from Cezanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh, the Fauves took painting back to its basic principles, inspired by primitive art, popular prints and children's paintings, and paved the way to Cubism. The artists, their work, their relationships, their achievements and the critical and commercial response to their work are discussed in this absorbing book, the first in many years to offer a reappraisal of Fauvism.""A remarkable, comprehensive achievement.""—The New York Times Book Review",English,9780500202272,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Art History']",[],Paperback,,216,Thames Hudson,September 17th 1996,June 1996,[],48,"['8', '22', '13', '3', '2']",90.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485987894l/209936._SX318_.jpg,5,1,3.33

The company also sent along a new employee to guard its treasure. He was Jeronimus Corneliszoon, a disgraced and bankrupt man with great charisma and dangerously heretical ideas. With the help of a few disgruntled sailors, he hatched a plot to seize the ship and her riches. The mutiny might have succeeded, but in the dark morning hours of June 3, 1629, the Batavia smashed through a coral reef and ran aground on a small chain of islands near Australia. The captain and skipper escaped the wreck, and in a tiny lifeboat they set sail for Java—some 1,500 miles north—to summon help. More than 250 frightened survivors waded ashore, thankful to be alive. Unfortunately, Jeronimus and the mutineers had survived too, and the nightmare was only beginning.",English,9780609807163,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Adventure', 'Australia', 'Maritime', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Survival', 'Crime']",['Jeronimus Corneliszoon'],Paperback,,512,Broadway Books,May 27th 2003,February 12th 2002,[],2841,"['1101', '1170', '457', '86', '27']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320528804l/128824.jpg,5,1,5.42

28322296-depeche-mode,Depeche Mode:,,"Serhiy Zhadan, Miroslav Shkandrij (Translator)",3.93,"A poet and novelist whose work has been variously compared to Rimbaud, Charles Bukowski and Irvine Welsh, Serhiy Zhadan’s first novel Depeche Mode depicts Ukrainian youth during the turbulent 1990s. Described by the author as “a book about real male comradeship,” the novel follows the unemployed narrator and his friends, Jewish anti-Semite Dogg Pavlov and Vasia the Communist, on their adventures around Kharkiv and beyond.  Against a background of social disintegration, slowly eroding Soviet mores and rapidly encroaching Western culture, the three comrades drink gratuitous amounts of vodka and embark on a quest to find their missing friend Sasha Carburetor to tell him about the suicide of his one-legged stepfather. Despite containing some darker themes, Depeche Mode takes an irreverent look at life; Zhadan is not afraid to mix philosophical musings and grotesque narrative with moments of slapstick comedy.  Serhiy Zhadan is one of the key voices in contemporary Ukrainian literature: his poetry and novels have enjoyed popularity at home and abroad. His poetic style and masterful wordplay have led critics to dub his trademark approach “verbal jazz”, a description that reflects his unique authorial voice. Zhadan stands as a witness to a time of great social change through the eyes of Ukraine’s dispossessed youth. His work explores the changes he has witnessed as a representative of the immediate post-Soviet generation in Ukraine. Never one to bow to convention, since giving up university teaching in 2004 Zhadan was involved in 2006’s Orange Revolution.

Drawing on dozens of interviews with players and front office executives, contemporary newspaper accounts, and personal papers, Tygiel provides the most telling and insightful account of Jackie Robinson's influence on American baseball and society.

  This is a full-length, science-fiction, alien abduction romance that was previously released as part of a two-book collection introducing the first books in two series. Each book is now being released separately. This revised edition of The Scorpion's Mate has some small changes from the original.
  Claire has never really fit in with everyone around her, but she's carved out a life for herself using her own unique style and artistic ability to support herself on the Internet. The last thing she expects is to be abducted by aliens and dropped into a research facility, where a genetically-engineered alien soldier chooses her as his life-mate.
  Thrax’s pheromones are compelling, and his status as a fellow unwilling test subject makes them allies, but Claire isn't certain she can trust someone who is convinced she belongs to him, when all she wants to do is find a way to return home to Earth - a place that her devoted alien can never follow, because there’s no way the scorpion-like alien would ever be able to pass for human.
  Still, she’ll accept help where she can find it, so she doesn't hesitate to escape with Thrax from the facility, though their time running from their pursuers in the warrens beneath the research facility will forever change Claire, and could make it impossible for her to return to Earth.
  But will there be anywhere else in the galaxy they can go where their love will be accepted?

This new edition incorporates the striking developments that have taken place in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence and notes their expanding relevance to philosophical issues.Churchland organizes and clarifies the new theoretical and experimental results of the natural sciences for a wider philosophical audience, observing that this research bears directly on questions concerning the basic elements of cognitive activity and their implementation in real physical systems. (How is it, he asks, that living creatures perform some cognitive tasks so swiftly and easily, where computers do them only badly or not at all?)

2417663.Nomad,Nomad: A Year In the Life of a Qashqa'i Tribesman in Iran,,Lois Beck,3.13,"Borzu Qermezi was the headman and political leader of a group of nomadic pastoralists who were part of the Qashqa'i confederacy of southwest Iran. Proud, complex, strong-willed, witty, and cunning, Borzu successfully led his people on their annual migrations for many years. He regulated their travel; mediated conflicts; intervened in (and sometimes exacerbated) tense situations between his people and other nomads; and dealt with the government police agency. Structuring the account around the four seasons, Lois Beck recounts the day-to-day activities of Borzu during the year she spent traveling with his people. She describes the rigors of nomadic life and the consequences of decisions made in haste.During 1970 to 1971, Borzu and his people were faced with many difficulties. When the expected winter rains did not fall, pastures and crops shriveled. Unable to sell their starving livestock for any profit, Borzu's people saw their debts to urban merchants and moneylenders increase. At the same time, Iran exercised more bureaucratic control over the Qashqa'i by applying new policies over migratory schedules and the allocation of scarce pastures, and by introducing non-Qashqa'i agriculturalists and livestock investors as legitimate land users. All these measures threatened the nomad's way of life and eventually undermined the role of headmen such as Borzu. Lois Beck details the vicissitudes endured by Borzu's people and the strategies he devised to cope with them.Blending ethnographic and historical material, this book contains information unavailable for other tribal and nomadic pastoral groups in the Middle East and central Asia. Through Beck's deft analysis, we come to understand why nomadic pastoralism was once an important part of this vast region, and why tribal society has endured.",English,9780520070035,[],[],Hardcover,,482,University of California Press,December 19th 1991,November 19th 1991,[],8,"['1', '2', '2', '3', '0']",62.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266806336l/2417663.jpg,4,1,22.82

538926.Music_and_the_Ineffable,Music and the Ineffable,,Vladimir Jankélévitch,4.24,"Vladimir Jank�l�vitch left behind a remarkable œuvre steeped as much in philosophy as in music. His writings on moral quandaries reflect a lifelong devotion to music and performance, and, as a counterpoint, he wrote on music aesthetics and on modernist composers such as Faur�, Debussy, and Ravel. Music and the Ineffable brings together these two threads, the philosophical and the musical, as an extraordinary quintessence of his thought. Jank�l�vitch deals with classical issues in the philosophy of music, including metaphysics and ontology. These are a point of departure for a sustained examination and dismantling of the idea of musical hermeneutics in its conventional sense.Music, Jank�l�vitch argues, is not a hieroglyph, not a language or sign system; nor does it express emotions, depict landscapes or cultures, or narrate. On the other hand, music cannot be imprisoned within the icy, morbid notion of pure structure or autonomous discourse. Yet if musical works are not a cipher awaiting the decoder, music is nonetheless entwined with human experience, and with the physical, material reality of music in performance. Music is ""ineffable,"" as Jank�l�vitch puts it, because it cannot be pinned down, and has a capacity to engender limitless resonance in several domains. Jank�l�vitch's singular work on music was central to such figures as Roland Barthes and Catherine Cl�ment, and the complex textures and rhythms of his lyrical prose sound a unique note, until recently seldom heard outside the francophone world.",English,9780691090474,"['Music', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction']",[],Hardcover,,171,Princeton University Press,July 28th 2003,1961,[],51,"['24', '19', '5', '2', '1']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1372040852l/538926.jpg,4,1,32.72

Sheen (Goodreads Author),5.0,"Death exposes the dangerous state of affairs in our ""sick-care system"" and the dangers of the current medical/pharmaceutical complex. Doctor’s causes over 800,000 deaths and millions of life-threatening complications each year. Or, as Harvard Professor Lucian Leape testified before Congress, it’s equivalent to six jumbo jets falling out of the sky every day!Whether it is from taking the billions of prescriptions for medications for high blood pressure or high cholesterol, for arthritis or insomnia, for depression or ADHD or the thousands of unnecessary surgeries taking place every day in hospitals throughout the country, readers will be presented with the horrifying facts to awaken them from the nightmare of todays prevailing medical system and be encouraged to discover alternatives. Research reveals how over 63 % of these deaths and injuries from the medical system were found to be preventable and over 75 % of the conditions patients were being treated for could be cured without medication or surgery!Dr. Sheen has been a healthcare professional for the past thirty years and has worked with hospitals, Health Departments, schools, wellness task forces and thousands of individuals in communities worldwide. He observed firsthand how the dependency of society upon a money driven sick-care system has caused great harm and dependency upon toxic medications and dangerous medical interventions. In his book he shares how this dependency begins at birth and is systematically impressed upon every person through every stage of life. Is it any wonder those 65 and above fill an average of 15 prescriptions per year, and this number rises with their age!As Dr Sheen shares “After fifty years of involvement in health and wellness, it is clear to me that each person MUST play an active role in maintaining their optimal functioning as a human being, physically, emotionally and mentally. We need to have the most up-to-date information available about our minds and bodies, which we must actively assert to protect our overall health. It is not about trusting or mistrusting the medical establishment, but it is being aware that sick-care is a business with rules and regulations which often prove to be more to their advantage than to ours. We each need to understand the realities of the pressures those in the medical profession have and the near-impossible task of continually staying at the cutting-edge of the many diverse disciplines of medicine, science and technology and become an active and informed participant in maintaining our health and avoiding dangerous medical interventions.”Dr Sheen’s companion book, The Epigenetic Cure; Re-educating Your Cells and DNA for Optimal Health then shares a wide variety of successful non toxic and life sustaining alternative scientific approaches.",,B0884LBWG2,[],[],Kindle Edition,,139,Quantum Embodiment Publications; 1 edition,May 4th 2020,,[],2,[],,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1592212844l/54063308._SY475_.jpg,4,1,

4691109-enlightenment,"Enlightenment: Reason, Tolerance, and Humanity",,James Schmidt,3.41,"The Enlightenment stands at the threshold of the modern age. It elevated the natural sciences to the preeminent position they enjoy in modern culture. It inaugurated a skepticism toward tradition and authority that decisively shaped modern attitudes in religion, morality, and politics. And it gave birth to a vision of history that saw man, through the unfettered use of his own reason, at last escaping that state of “immaturity” to which superstition, prejudice, and dogma had condemned him. The world in which we live is, for better or worse, in large part the result of the Enlightenment. This course will explore this remarkable period. It will discuss the work of such influential thinkers as Voltaire, John Locke, Denis Diderot, Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant, and Benjamin Franklin. It will also spend some time with less well-known, but no less influential, figures such as Joseph Priestly—a clergyman, scientist, and philosopher who was one of the most passionate defenders of the American Revolution in England—and the remarkable John Toland, a man whose writings on religion changed the way many Europeans thought about the Scriptures. The Enlightenment involved more than simply books and ideas. To understand the Enlightenment we need to look not just at what people wrote but also at how they lived. During the eighteenth century, they began to congregate in coffeehouses, where they read newspapers, discussed politics, and created something known as “public opinion.” Others of them began to meet in societies that were dedicated to the advancement of the sciences and there they explored how science might be put to work improving society. Still others began to meet in strange new secret societies—for example, the Masonic lodges that spread across Europe—where they attempted to put the ideals of equality and brotherhood into practice. From the start, the Enlightenment has been controversial. In its own day, some argued that it threatened to undermine the moral and religious foundations on which society rested. It has not ceased to be controversial. In our day, some have charged that many of the maladies of modern societies can be traced to its shallow rationalism. This course offers a more balanced assessment of the Enlightenment, considering both its achievements and its shortcomings and focusing not only on its most important intellectual achievements but also on the strange and often colorful characters who populated it. - From the Publisher",English,9781419337154,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy']",[],Audiobook,,8,"Prince Frederick, MD, [Boulder, Colo Recorded Books",2007,,[],46,"['8', '12', '20', '3', '3']",87.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1269415182l/4691109.jpg,3,1,

31204695-the-signal-flame,The Signal Flame,,Andrew Krivak,3.98,"The stunning second novel from National Book Award finalist Andrew Krivak—a heartbreaking, captivating story about a family awaiting the return of their youngest son from the Vietnam War.In a small town in Pennsylvania’s Endless Mountains Hannah and her son Bo mourn the loss of the family patriarch, Jozef Vinich. They were three generations under one roof. Three generations, but only one branch of a scraggy tree; they are a war-haunted family in a war-torn century. Having survived the trenches of World War I as an Austro-Hungarian conscript, Vinich journeyed to America and built a life for his family. His daughter married the Hungarian-born Bexhet Konar, who enlisted to fight with the Americans in the Second World War but brought disgrace on the family when he was imprisoned for desertion. He returned home to Pennsylvania a hollow man, only to be killed in a hunting accident on the family’s land. Finally, in 1971, Hannah’s prodigal younger son, Sam, was reported MIA in Vietnam.And so there is only Bo, a quiet man full of conviction, a proud work ethic, and a firstborn’s sense of duty. He is left to grieve but also to hope for reunion, to create a new life, to embrace the land and work its soil through the seasons. The Signal Flame is a stirring novel about generations of men and women and the events that define them, brothers who take different paths, the old European values yielding to new world ways, and the convalescence of memory and war.Beginning shortly after Easter in 1972 and ending on Christmas Eve this ambitious novel beautifully evokes ordinary time, a period of living and working while waiting and watching and expecting. The Signal Flame is gorgeously written, honoring the cycles of earth and body, humming with blood and passion, and it confirms Andrew Krivak as a writer of extraordinary vision and power.",en,9781501126376,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'War', 'Literary Fiction', 'Family', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Adult Fiction', 'Americana', 'American']",[],Kindle Edition,,288,Scribner,January 24th 2017,,[],765,"['225', '346', '152', '34', '8']",95.0,['Pennsylvania (United States)'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1469305668l/31204695._SY475_.jpg,3,1,3.87

The duende is portrayed by Lorca as a demonic earth spirit containing irrationality, earthiness, and a heightened awareness of death. In Search of Duende gathers Lorca's writings about the duende and about three art forms most susceptible to it: dance, music, and the bullfight. A full bilingual sampling of Lorca's poetry is also included, with special attention to poems arising from traditional Spanish verse forms. The result is an excellent introduction to Lorca's poetry and prose for American readers.",English,9780811213769,"['Poetry', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Literary Criticism', 'Spanish Literature', 'Spain', 'Philosophy', 'Literature', 'Art', '20th Century']",[],Paperback,,99,New Directions,April 17th 1998,1933,[],795,"['414', '240', '109', '24', '8']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389089623l/31580.jpg,3,1,3.59

Half-man, half-god, musician, magician, theologian, poet and lover, his story never leaves us. He may be myth, but his lyre still sounds, entrancing everything that hears it: animals, trees, water, stones, and men.In this extraordinary work Ann Wroe goes in search of Orpheus, from the forests where he walked and the mountains where he worshipped to the artefacts, texts and philosophies built up round him. She traces the man, and the power he represents, through the myriad versions of a fantastical life: his birth in Thrace, his studies in Egypt, his voyage with the Argonauts to fetch the Golden Fleece, his love for Eurydice and journey to Hades, and his terrible death. We see him tantalising Cicero and Plato, and breathing new music into Gluck and Monteverdi; occupying the mind of Jung and the surreal dreams of Cocteau; scandalising the Fathers of the early Church, and filling Rilke with poems like a whirlwind. He emerges as not simply another mythical figure but the force of creation itself, singing the song of light out of darkness and life out of death.",English,9780224091367,"['Nonfiction', 'Mythology', 'History', 'Music', 'Poetry', 'Classics', 'Biography', 'Religion', 'Classical Studies', 'Retellings']",[],Hardcover,,272,Jonathan Cape,July 14th 2011,,['John D.

It reaffirms Rushdie’s standing . . . at the very front rank of contemporary literary novelists.”–Baltimore SunMalik Solanka, historian of ideas and world-famous dollmaker, steps out of his life one day, abandons his family in London without a word of explanation, and flees for New York. There’s a fury within him, and he fears he has become dangerous to those he loves. He arrives in New York at a time of unprecedented plenty, in the highest hour of America’s wealth and power, seeking to “erase” himself. But fury is all around him. An astonishing work of explosive energy, Fury is by turns a pitiless and pitch-black comedy, a love story of mesmerizing force, and a disturbing inquiry into the darkest side of human nature.“Rushdie’s ideas–about society, about culture, about politics–are embedded in his stories and in the interlocking momentum with which he tells them. . . . All of Rushdie’s synthesizing energy, the way he brings together ancient myth and old story, contemporary incident and archetypal emotion, transfigures reason into a waking dream.”–Los Angeles Times Book Review“Well, here it is, then, his first 3-D, full-volume American novel, finger-snapping, wildly stupefying, often slyly funny, red-blooded and red-toothed.

2545620.Benjamin_Dove,Benjamin Dove,,"Fridrik Erlings (Goodreads Author), Fridrik Erlings (Goodreads Author)",3.76,"As an adult, Benjamin Dove looks back on a childhood summer that changed his life forever. A summer when his new friend Roland, seemingly descended from the knights of the past, encouraged him to stand up for himself and for those he loves. It was a summer when he and his friends formed the Order of the Red Dragon that gave them a sense of identity and purpose in their turbulent world; a summer when innocent childhood games were torn apart by an almost inevitable tragedy. Benjamin Dove is a brilliantly conceived work of fiction, tinged with both light and dark humor. Disturbing themes are explored, from bullying to child abuse to rivalry, yet there is always a sense of a child's unbreakable spirit. Published to acclaim in 1992, Benjamin Dove has won several book awards, including the International Board on Books for Young People Award (the IBBY), The Icelandic Children's Book Award, and the Reykjavik City Children's Book Award.

Instead, we quickly jump to the enemy-loving, forgiving Jesus of the New Testament. And yet, the question doesn't go away. Did God really command genocide? Is the command to ""utterly destroy"" morally unjustifiable? Is it literal? Are the issues more complex and nuanced than we realize?In the tradition of his popular Is God a Moral Monster?, Paul Copan teams up with Matthew Flannagan to tackle some of the most confusing and uncomfortable passages of Scripture. Together they help the Christian and nonbeliever alike understand the biblical, theological, philosophical, and ethical implications of Old Testament warfare passages.

He regarded theology as the ""handmaiden"" of knowledge and believed that through reason, people could attain a greater knowledge of God. ""By doubting,"" he declared, ""we come to inquire, and by inquiry we arrive at truth.""

22121.Imperial_Life_in_the_Emerald_City,Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone,,Rajiv Chandrasekaran,4.03,"An unprecedented account of life in Baghdad’s Green Zone, a walled-off enclave of towering plants, posh villas, and sparkling swimming pools that was the headquarters for the American occupation of Iraq.The Washington Post’s former Baghdad bureau chief Rajiv Chandrasekaran takes us with him into the Zone: into a bubble, cut off from wartime realities, where the task of reconstructing a devastated nation competed with the distractions of a Little America—a half-dozen bars stocked with cold beer, a disco where women showed up in hot pants, a movie theater that screened shoot-’em-up films, an all-you-could-eat buffet piled high with pork, a shopping mall that sold pornographic movies, a parking lot filled with shiny new SUVs, and a snappy dry-cleaning service—much of it run by Halliburton. Most Iraqis were barred from entering the Emerald City for fear they would blow it up. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and internal documents, Chandrasekaran tells the story of the people and ideas that inhabited the Green Zone during the occupation, from the imperial viceroy L. Paul Bremer III to the fleet of twentysomethings hired to implement the idea that Americans could build a Jeffersonian democracy in an embattled Middle Eastern country. In the vacuum of postwar planning, Bremer ignores what Iraqis tell him they want or need and instead pursues irrelevant neoconservative solutions—a flat tax, a sell-off of Iraqi government assets, and an end to food rationing. His underlings spend their days drawing up pie-in-the-sky policies, among them a new traffic code and a law protecting microchip designs, instead of rebuilding looted buildings and restoring electricity production. His almost comic initiatives anger the locals and help fuel the insurgency. Chandrasekaran details Bernard Kerik’s ludicrous attempt to train the Iraqi police and brings to light lesser known but typical travesties: the case of the twenty-four-year-old who had never worked in finance put in charge of reestablishing Baghdad’s stock exchange; a contractor with no previous experience paid millions to guard a closed airport; a State Department employee forced to bribe Americans to enlist their help in preventing Iraqi weapons scientists from defecting to Iran; Americans willing to serve in Iraq screened by White House officials for their views on Roe v. Wade; people with prior expertise in the Middle East excluded in favor of lesser-qualified Republican Party loyalists. Finally, he describes Bremer’s ignominious departure in 2004, fleeing secretly in a helicopter two days ahead of schedule. This is a startling portrait of an Oz-like place where a vital aspect of our government’s folly in Iraq played out. It is a book certain to be talked about for years to come.",English,9781400044870,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Journalism', 'Military History', 'American History', 'Audiobook', 'American']",[],Hardcover,,320,Knopf,September 19th 2006,2006,"['Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2007)', 'Ridenhour Book Prize (2007)', 'Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction (2007)', 'Cornelius Ryan Award (2006)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction (2006)']",5666,"['1812', '2500', '1096', '211', '47']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388184155l/22121.jpg,1,1,3.59

W Afganistanie nie ma dróg na skróty, nie ma miejsca na udawanie, wszystko ma wymiar podstawowy. W Boga wierzy się tu naprawdę, a wolność ma posmak anarchii. Historia Afgańczyków, zwykle wbrew nim samym, jest nieustannym pasmem rewolucji i kontrrewolucji, tragicznie nieudanych poszukiwań doskonałego sposobu życia oraz natychmiastowego odrzucania wszystkiego, co obce, narzucone, co okazywało się pomyłką lub wymagało odstąpienia od utopijnych zazwyczaj wyobrażeń. Modlitwa o deszcz jest kroniką powstawania i upadków afgańskich reżimów oraz bratobójczych wojen, pocztem komendantów, watażków, świętobliwych mułłów i walecznych wojowników, ale przede wszystkim opowieścią o bezkompromisowym poszukiwaniu Absolutu, zabójczym i jednocześnie pozwalającym zachować godność, wolność oraz wierność podstawowym wartościom.",Polish,9788374143318,"['Nonfiction', 'Polish Literature', 'History', 'Reportage', 'War', 'Asia', 'Literature', 'Travel', 'Poland']",[],Paperback,,480,Wydawnictwo W.A.B.,April 2007,2002,['Amber Butterfly Prize (Arkady Fidler Travel Competition) (2003)'],395,"['186', '158', '46', '4', '1']",99.0,['Afghanistan'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1220697717l/4565266.jpg,1,1,

Based on extensive research amongst both migrants who sell sex and social helpers, Sex at the Margins provides a radical analysis. Frequently, says Agustín, migrants make rational choices to travel and work in the sex industry.

The girls all have something in common, but what is it? What crime has brought them here from the city? Who is the mysterious security company responsible for this desolate place with its brutal rules, its total isolation from the contemporary world?

As Harper gripped the bars of her cage, in the alien prison; it sunk in that she seriously had been kidnapped from Earth, to become the fated consort of some alien prince. This wasn’t some elaborate prank, or government experiment. True to form, Harper pissed off the tyrannical king with her refusal. Now she found herself at the mercy of convicts, locked away and forgotten in the bowels of a mountain. Harper’s gaze fell on a shadowy beast of a man, sitting casually on the rundown catwalk. The imposing man looked like he ruled the prison. He was the color of midnight, and his eyes were that eerie arctic blue, that was nearly colorless. Harper shivered as he regarded her. All Nameless knew was the Hold, with its misery and struggle. He never wanted to keep a female, surviving was hard enough, but that was before the Pink Pearl dropped into his world. Nameless had never seen anything like the stunning exotic little creature. Not only was she the catalyst for strange dreams and revelations about his past, but she made him feel. He had to have her. >Harper wanted free of the alien prison, and she wanted to go home, except Nameless wasn’t prepared or willing to let her go, even if she hated him because of it. He owned every part of her, and bound her to him, in ways that could never be undone, collar or no collar. In her wildest dreams, Harper never imagined the twists destiny could take, or that she would find soul deep satisfaction with such a nameless fate. Follow Harper and Nameless as they struggle to get free of the Hold, and seek their revenge on the despot responsible for putting them there.
